We make an explicit correspondence between the game denotation of a
term and its syntax. Our approach follows ideas recently introduced
in \cite{OngLics2006}, mainly the notion of computation tree of a
simply-typed $\lambda$-term and traversals over the computation
tree. A computation tree can be regarded as an abstract syntax tree
(AST) of the $\eta$-long normal form of a term. A traversal is a
justified sequence of nodes of the computation tree respecting some
formation rules. Traversals are used to describe computations. An
interesting property is that the \emph{P-view} of a traversal
(computed in the same way as P-view of plays in Game Semantics) is a
path in the computation tree.

The main result of this paper is called the
\emph{Correspondence Theorem} (theorem \ref{thm:correspondence}). It
states that traversals over the computation tree are just
representations of the uncovering of plays in the
strategy-denotation of the term. Hence there is an isomorphism
between the strategy denotation of a term and its revealed game
denotation ({\it i.e.}~its strategy denotation where internal moves are
not hidden after composition). This theorem permits us to explore
the effect that a given syntactic restriction (such as the safety restriction) has on the strategy
denoting a term.

To really make use of the Correspondence Theorem, it will be
necessary to restate it in the standard game-semantic framework in
which internal moves are hidden. For that purpose, we will define a
\emph{reduction} operation on traversals responsible of eliminating
the ``internal nodes'' of the computation. This leads to a
correspondence between the standard game denotation of a term and
the set of reductions of traversals over its computation tree.
Fortunately, the reduction operation preserves the good properties
of traversals. This is guaranteed by the facts that the P-view of
the reduction of a traversal is equal to the reduction of the P-view
of the traversal, and the O-view of a traversal is the same as the
O-view of its reduction (lemma \ref{lem:redtrav_trav}). \vspace{8pt}

\emph{Related works}: Traversals of a computation tree provide a way
to perform \emph{local computation} of $\beta$-reductions as opposed
to a global approach where the $\beta$-reduction is implemented by
performing substitutions. A notion of local computation of
$\beta$-reduction has been investigated in
\cite{DanosRegnier-Localandasynchronou} through the use of special
graphs called ``virtual nets'' that embed the lambda-calculus.

In \cite{DBLP:conf/lics/AspertiDLR94}, a notion of graph based on
Lamping's graphs \citep{lamping} is introduced to represent
$\lambda$-terms. The authors unify different notions of paths
(regular, legal, consistent and persistent paths) that have appeared
in the literature as ways to implement graph-based reduction of
lambda-expressions. We can regard a traversal as an alternative
notion of path adapted to the graph representation of
$\lambda$-expressions given by computation trees.



%Is there any unsafe term whose game semantics is a strategy where
%pointers can be recovered?
%
%The answer is yes: take the term $T_i = (\lambda x y . y) M_i S$
%where $i =1..2$ and $\Gamma \vdash_s S : A$. $T_1$ and $T_2$ both
%$\beta$-reduce to the safe term $S$, therefore
%$\sem{T_1}=\sem{T_2}=\sem{S}$. But $T_1$ is safe whereas $T_2$ is
%unsafe. Since it is possible to recover the pointer from the game
%semantics of $S$, it is as well possible to recover the pointer from
%the semantics of $T_2$ which is unsafe.

\section{Computation tree}
We work in the general setting of the simply-typed
$\lambda$-calculus extended with a fixed set $\Sigma$ of
higher-order constants.

\subsection{$\eta$-long normal form}

The $\eta$-long normal form appeared in
\citep{DBLP:journals/tcs/JensenP76} and
\citep{DBLP:journals/tcs/Huet75} under the names \emph{long reduced
form} and \emph{$\eta$-normal form} respectively. It was then
investigated in \citep{huet76} under the name \emph{extensional
form}.

The $\eta$-expansion of $M: A\typear B$ is defined to be the term
$\lambda x . M x : A\typear B$ where $x:A$ is a fresh variable. A
term $M : (A_1,\ldots,A_n,o)$ can be expanded in several steps into
$\lambda \varphi_1 \ldots \varphi_l . M \varphi_1 \ldots \varphi_l$
where the $\varphi_i:A_i$ are fresh variables. The $\eta$-normal
form of a term is obtained by hereditarily $\eta$-expanding every
subterm occurring at an operand position.

\begin{definition}[$\eta$-long normal form]
A simply-typed term is either an abstraction or it can be written uniquely as
$s_0 s_1 \ldots s_m$ where $m\geq0$ and $s_0$ is a variable, a $\Sigma$-constant or an abstraction.
The $\eta$-long normal form of a term $t$, written $\elnf{t}$ or sometimes $\etanf{t}$,
is defined as follows:
\begin{align*}
\elnf{\lambda x . s } &= \lambda x . \elnf{s} \\
\elnf{\alpha s_1 \ldots s_m : (A_1,\ldots,A_n,o)} &= \lambda \overline{\varphi} . \alpha \elnf{s_1}\ldots \elnf{s_m} \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n}
& \mbox{with $m,n\geq0$}\\
\elnf{(\lambda x . s) s_1 \ldots s_p : (A_1,\ldots,A_n,o) } &= \lambda \overline{\varphi} . (\lambda x . \elnf{s}) \elnf{s_1} \ldots \elnf{s_p} \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n}
& \mbox{with $p\geq 1,n\geq 0$}
\end{align*}
where $x$ and each $\varphi_i : A_i$ are variables and $\alpha$ is
either a variable or a constant.
\end{definition}

For $n=0$, the first clause in the definition becomes:
$$\elnf{x s_1 \ldots s_m : o} = \lambda . x \elnf{s_1} \elnf{s_2} \ldots \elnf{s_m},$$
and we deliberately keep the \textsl{dummy} lambda in the right-hand
side of the equation because it will play an important role in the
correspondence with game semantics.



Note that our version of the $\eta$-long normal form is defined not only for $\beta$-normal terms but also for any simply-typed term.
Moreover it is defined in such a way that $\beta$-normality is preserved:
\begin{lemma}
The $\eta$-long normal form of a term in $\beta$-normal form is also in $\beta$-normal form.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By induction on the structure of the term and the order of its type.
\emph{Base case}:
If $M=x:0$ then $\elnf{x} = \lambda . x$ is also in $\beta$-nf.
\emph{Step case}:
The case $M = (\lambda x . s) s_1 \ldots s_m : (A_1,\ldots,A_n,o)$ with $m>0$ is not possible since $M$ is in
$\beta$-normal form.
Suppose $M = \lambda x . s$ then $s$ is in $\beta$-nf. By the induction hypothesis $\elnf{s}$ is also in $\beta$-nf and therefore
so is $\elnf{M} = \lambda x . \elnf{s}$.

Suppose $M= \alpha s_1 \ldots s_m : (A_1,\ldots,A_n,o)$. Let $i,j$
range over $1..n$ and $1..m$ respectively. The $s_j$ are in
$\beta$-nf and the $\varphi_i$ are variables of order smaller than
$M$, therefore by the induction hypothesis the $\elnf{\varphi_i}$ and
the $\elnf{s_j}$ are in $\beta$-nf. Hence $\elnf{M}$ is also in
$\beta$-nf.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[$\eta$-long normalisation preserves safety]
If $\Gamma \vdash s$ then $\Gamma \vdash \elnf{s}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

First we observe that for any variable or constant $x$ we have $x \vdash \elnf{x}$. The proof is by induction on $\ord{x}$. Base case: $x$ is of ground type and we have $x \vdash x = \elnf{x}$. Step case:
$x:(A_1, \ldots, A_n,o)$ with $n>0$. Let $\varphi_i:A_i$ be fresh variables for $1\leq i\leq n$. The (var) rules gives $\varphi_i  \vdash \varphi_i$ and since $\ord{A_i} < \ord{x}$ the induction hypothesis gives $\varphi_i \vdash \elnf{\varphi_i}$. Using (wk) we obtain $x, \overline{\varphi} \vdash \elnf{\varphi_i}$.
The application rule gives $x, \overline{\varphi} \vdash x \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n} : o$ and the abstraction rule gives $ x \vdash \lambda \overline{\varphi} . x \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n} = \elnf{x}$.


We now prove the lemma by induction on the structure of $s$.
The base case (where $s$ is some variable $x$) is covered by the previous observation.
\emph{Step case:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $s = x s_1 \ldots s_m$ with $x: (B_1, \ldots, B_m, A_1, \ldots, A_n, o)$ with $m\geq 0$, $n>0$ and $s_i : B_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$.

Let $\varphi_i: A_i$ be fresh variables for $1\leq i \leq n$. By the previous observation we have $\varphi_i \vdash \elnf{\varphi_i}$ which in turn gives $\Gamma , \overline{\varphi} \vdash \elnf{\varphi_i}$ using the weakening rule.

The judgement $\Gamma \vdash x s_1 \ldots s_m$ is formed using the (app) rule therefore each $s_j$ is safe for $1\leq j \leq m$. By the induction hypothesis we have $\Gamma \vdash \elnf{s_j}$ and by weakening we get $\Gamma, \overline{\varphi} \vdash \elnf{s_j}$.

The application rule gives $\Gamma, \overline{\varphi} \vdash
x \elnf{s_1} \ldots \elnf{s_m} \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n} : o$. Finally the (abs) rule gives $\Gamma \vdash \lambda \overline{\varphi} . x \elnf{s_1} \ldots \elnf{s_m}  \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n} = \elnf{s}$, the side-condition of (abs) being met since $\ord{\elnf{s}} = \ord{s}$.


\item $s = t s_0 \ldots s_m$ where $t$ is an abstraction. Again, using the induction hypothesis it is easy to show that $\Gamma \vdash \elnf{s} = \elnf{t} \elnf{s_0} \ldots \elnf{s_m} \elnf{\varphi_1} \ldots \elnf{\varphi_n}$ holds for some fresh variables $\varphi_1$, \ldots, $\varphi_n$.

\item $s = \lambda \overline{\eta} . t$ where $t$ is not an abstraction. By the induction hypothesis we have $\Gamma, \overline{\eta} \vdash \elnf{t}$ and by the abstraction rule we have $\Gamma \vdash \lambda \overline{\eta} . \elnf{t} = \elnf{s}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

Note that in general the converse does not hold, for instance $\lambda x^o . f^{o,(o,o),o} x^o$ is unsafe although $\elnf{\lambda x . f x} = \lambda x^o \varphi^{o,o} . f x \varphi$ is safe (and not homogeneous). For terms with homogeneous types however, the converse does hold:
\begin{lemma}
If $\Gamma \vdash \elnf{s}$ is homogeneously safe (i.e. it is a safe judgement of the safe $\lambda$-calculus and each sequent occurring at the nodes of the proof tree is homogeneously typed) then
$\Gamma \vdash s$ is homogeneously safe.
\end{lemma}


\subsection{Computation tree}
The computation tree of a term is a certain tree representation of its
$\eta$-long normal form. It is defined as follows:
\begin{definition}[Computation tree]
For any term $M$ in $\eta$-normal form we define the tree $\tau(M)$ by induction
on the structure of the term.
Since $M$ is in $\eta$-normal form, there are only two cases:
$M$ is either an abstraction or it is of ground type and can be written uniquely as
$s_0 s_1 \ldots s_m : 0$ where $m\geq0$,  $s_0$ is a variable, a
constant or an abstraction and each of the $s_j$ for $j\in 1..m$ is in $\eta$-normal form:
\begin{itemize}
\item the tree for $\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n. s$ where $n\geq0$ and $s$ is not an abstraction is:
$$ \tau(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n . s) =
      \pstree[levelsep=3ex]
        { \TR{\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n} }
        { \SubTree{\tau(s)^{-}} }
$$
where $\tau(s)^{-}$ denotes the tree obtained after deleting the root of $\tau(s)$.


\item the tree for $\alpha s_1 \ldots s_m : o$ where $m\geq0$ and $\alpha$ is a variable or constant is:
$$ \tau( \alpha s_1 \ldots s_m) =
    \tree{\lambda}
    {
        \pstree[levelsep=3ex]
            { \TR{\alpha} }
            { \SubTree{\tau(s_1)} \SubTree[linestyle=none]{\ldots} \SubTree{\tau(s_m)}
            }
    }
$$


\item the tree for $(\lambda x.s) s_1 \ldots s_n : o$ where $n \geq 1$ is:
$$ \tau((\lambda x.s) s_1 \ldots s_n) =
    \tree{\lambda}
    {
        \pstree[levelsep=3ex]
            { \TR{@} }
            {
            \SubTree{\tau(\lambda x.s)}    \SubTree{\tau(s_1)} \SubTree[linestyle=none]{\ldots} \SubTree{\tau(s_n)}
            }
    }
$$
\end{itemize}

The \emph{computation tree} of a simply-typed term $M$ (whether or not in $\eta$-normal form) is written $\tau(M)$
and defined to be $\tau(M) = \tau(\etanf{M})$.
\end{definition}

The nodes (and leaves) of the tree are of three kinds:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\lambda$-nodes labelled $\lambda \overline{x}$ (note that a $\lambda$-node represents several consecutive variable abstractions),
\item application nodes labelled @,
\item variable or constant nodes labelled $\alpha$ for some constant or variable $\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
We write $N$ for the set of nodes of $\tau(M)$, $N_\Sigma$ for the set of $\Sigma$-labelled nodes,
$N_@$ for the set of @-labelled nodes, $N_{var}$ for the set of variable nodes,
$N_{fv}$ for the subset of $N_{var}$ constituted of free-variable nodes and $r$ for the root of $\tau(M)$.


Let $\mathcal{T}$ denote the set of $\lambda$-terms.
Each subtree of the computation tree $\tau(M)$ represents a subterm of $\elnf{M}$.
We define the function $\kappa : N \rightarrow \mathcal{T}$ that maps a node $n \in N$ to the subterm of $\elnf{M}$
represented by the subtree of $\tau(M)$ rooted at $n$.
In particular if $r$ is the root of $\tau(M)$ then $\kappa(r) = \elnf{M}$.

\begin{definition}[Type and order of a node]
\label{def:nodeorder}
Suppose $\Gamma \vdash M : T$.
Each node $n$ of $\tau(M)$ is assigned a type $type(n)$ defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
type(r) &=& \Gamma \rightarrow T \\
type(\alpha:A) &=& A, \mbox{ where $\alpha$ is a variable or constant} \\
type(n) &=& B, \hbox{ where
$\kappa(n) : B$ for $n \in (N_\lambda \union N_@) \setminus \{r \}$\ .}
\end{eqnarray*}
The order of a node $n$ written $\ord{n}$ is defined to be $\ord{type(n)}$.
\end{definition}

In particular, $\ord{@} = 0$, $\ord{\lambda \overline{\xi}} = 1+ \max_{z\in \overline{\xi}} \ord{z}$ for $r \neq \lambda \overline{\xi}$
and if $r=\lambda \overline{\xi}$ then $\ord{r} = 1 + \max_{z\in \overline{\xi}\union \Gamma} \ord{z}$ with the convention that $\max \emptyset = -1$.

\noindent Some remarks:
\begin{itemize}
\item In a computation tree, nodes at even level are $\lambda$-nodes and nodes at odd level are either application nodes,
variable or constant nodes;

\item for any ground type variable or constant $\alpha$,
$\tau(\alpha) = \tau(\lambda . \alpha) =  \pstree[levelsep=3ex]
    { \TR{\lambda } }
    { \TR{\alpha}
    }$;

\item for any higher-order variable or constant $\alpha : (A_1,\ldots,A_p,o)$, the computation tree $\tau(\alpha)$ has the following form:
$ \pstree[levelsep=3ex]{\TR{\lambda}}
        {\pstree[levelsep=3ex]
                { \TR{\alpha} }
                { \tree{\lambda \overline{\xi_1}}{\TR{\ldots}} \TR{\ldots} \tree{\lambda \overline{\xi_p}}{\TR{\ldots}}
                }
        }
$;

\item for any tree of the form
        $ \pstree[levelsep=4ex]
            { \TR{\lambda \overline{\varphi}} }
            { \pstree[levelsep=3ex]
                {\TR{n}}
                {\TR{\lambda \overline{\xi_1}} \TR{\ldots} \TR{\lambda \overline{\xi_p}}}
            }
        $,
    we have $\ord{\kappa(n)}=0$.

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Pointers and justified sequence of nodes}

\begin{definition}[Binder]
Let $n$ be a variable node of the computation tree labelled $x$. We
say that a node $n$ is bound by the node $m$, and $m$ is called the
binder of $n$, if $m$ is the closest node in the path from $n$ to
the root of the tree such that $m$ is labelled $\lambda
\overline{\xi}$ with $x\in \overline{\xi}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Enabling]
The enabling relation $\vdash$ is defined on the set of nodes of the
computation tree. We write $m \vdash n$ and we say that $m$ enables
$n$ if and only if
\begin{itemize}
\item $n$ is a bound variable node and $m$ is the binder of $n$,
\item or $n$ is a free variable node and $m$ is the root of the computation tree,
\item or $n$ is a $\lambda$-node and $m$ is the parent node of $n$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

For any set of nodes $S$ we write $S^{\upharpoonright r}$ for $\{ n \in S \ | \ r  \vdash^* n \}$ -- the subset of $S$ constituted of
nodes hereditarily enabled by $r$.
We call \defname{input-variables nodes} the elements of $N_{var}^{\upharpoonright r}$ i.e.\
variables that are hereditarily enabled by the root. $N_{var}^{\upharpoonright r}$ is also the set of nodes that are hereditarily enabled by a free variable or by a variable bound by the root.

\begin{definition}[Justified sequence of nodes]
A \emph{justified sequence of nodes} is a sequence of
nodes of the computation tree $\tau(M)$ with pointers attached to the nodes. A node $n$ in the sequence
that is either a variable node or a lambda-node different from the root of the computation tree
has a pointer to a node $m$ occurring before $n$ in the sequence such that $m \vdash n$.
If $n$ points to $m$ then we say that $m$ \emph{justifies} $n$ and we represent the pointer in the sequence as follows:
$$\Pstr{ (m){m} \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-m,40){n}}$$
Such pointer is sometimes labelled with an index $i$:
indicating that $n$ is labelled with the $i$th
variable abstracted in $m$ if $m$ is a $\lambda$-node, or that $n$ is the $i$th child of $m$
otherwise.
\end{definition}
Note that justified sequences are also defined for open terms:
occurrences of nodes in $N_{fv}$ must point to an occurrence of the
root of the computation tree.

A pointer in a justified sequence of nodes has
one of the following forms: \vspace{2pt}
$$
\Pstr{ (m){r} \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-m,40){z} }
\hspace{1.5cm}
\Pstr{ (m){\lambda \overline{\xi}} \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-m,40:i){\xi_i} }
\hspace{1.5cm}
\Pstr{ (m){@} \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-m,40:j){\lambda \overline{\eta}} }
\hspace{1.5cm}
\Pstr{ (m){\alpha } \cdot \ldots \cdot (n-m,40:k){\lambda \overline{\eta}} }
$$
where $r$ denotes the root of $\tau(M)$, $z \in N_{fv}$, $\xi_1,
\ldots \xi_n$ are bound variables, $\alpha \in N_{\Sigma} \union
N_{var}$, $i \in 1..n$, $j$ ranges from $0$ to the number of
children nodes of @ minus 1 and $k \in 1 ..arity(\alpha)$.

The following numbering conventions are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item the first child of a @-node is numbered $0$,
\item the first child of a variable or constant node is numbered $1$,
\item variables in $\overline{\xi}$ are numbered from $1$ onward ($\overline{\xi} = \xi_1 \ldots \xi_n$).
\end{itemize}
We use the notation $n.i$ to denote the $i$th child of node $n$.


We write $s = t$ to denote that the justified sequences $t$ and $s$
have same nodes \emph{and} pointers. Justified sequence of nodes can
be ordered using the prefix ordering: $t \sqsubseteq t'$ if and only
if $t=t'$ or the sequence of nodes $t$ is a finite prefix of $t'$
(and the pointers of $t$ are the same as the pointers of the
corresponding prefix of $t'$). Note that with this definition,
infinite justified sequences can also be compared. This ordering
gives rise to a complete partial order.

We say that a node $n_0$ of a justified sequence is hereditarily justified by $n_p$ if there are nodes $n_1, n_2, \ldots n_{p-1}$ in
the sequence such that for all $i\in 0..p-1$, $n_i$ points to $n_{i+1}$.

If $H$ is a set of nodes and $s$ a justified sequence of nodes then we write $s \upharpoonright H$ to denote the subsequence of $s$ obtained by keeping only the nodes that are hereditarily justified by nodes in $H$. This subsequence is also a justified
sequence of nodes. If $n$ denotes a node of $\tau(M)$ we abbreviate $s \upharpoonright \{ n \}$ into $ s\upharpoonright n$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:filtercontinous}
For any set of node $N$, the filtering function $\_ \upharpoonright N$ defined on the cpo of justified sequences ordered by the prefix ordering
is continuous.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Clearly $\_ \upharpoonright N$ is monotonous.
Suppose that $(t_i)_{i\in\omega}$ is a chain of justified sequence of nodes. Let $u$ be a finite prefix of $(\bigvee t_i) \upharpoonright r$.
Then $u = s \upharpoonright r$ for some finite prefix $s$ of $\bigvee t_i$. Since $s$ is finite we must have $s \sqsubseteq t_j$ for some $j\in\omega$.
Therefore $u \sqsubseteq t_j \upharpoonright r \sqsubseteq \bigvee (t_j \upharpoonright r)$.
This is valid for any finite prefix $u$ therefore $(\bigvee t_i) \upharpoonright r \sqsubseteq \bigvee (t_j \upharpoonright r)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}[P-view of justified sequence of nodes]
The P-view of a justified sequence of nodes $t$ of $\tau(M)$, written $\pview{t}$, is defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \pview{\epsilon} &=&  \epsilon \\
 \pview{s \cdot n }  &=&  \pview{s} \cdot n \\
 \pview{\Pstr{ s \cdot (m){m} \cdot \ldots \cdot (lmd-m,25){\lambda \overline{\xi}}}} &=&
        \Pstr{ \pview{s} \cdot (m2){m} \cdot (lmd2-m2,60){\lambda \overline{\xi}} } \\
 \pview{s \cdot r }  &=&  r
\end{eqnarray*}
where $r$ is the root of the tree $\tau(M)$ and $n$ ranges over
non-lambda nodes (i.e. $N_\Sigma \union N_@ \union N_{var}$).

In the second clause, the pointer associated to $n$ is preserved
from the left-hand side to the right-hand side i.e. if in the
left-hand side, $n$ points to some node in $s$ that is also present
in $\pview{s}$ then in the right-hand side, $n$ points to this
occurrence of the node in $\pview{s}$.

Similarly, in the third clause the pointer associated to $m$ is preserved.
\end{definition}

We also define O-view, the dual notion of P-view:
\begin{definition}[O-view of justified sequence of nodes]
The O-view of a justified sequence of nodes $t$ of $\tau(M)$, written $\oview{t}$, is defined as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \oview{\epsilon} &=&  \epsilon \\
 \oview{s \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi} }  &=&  \oview{s} \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi} \\
 \oview{\Pstr{s \cdot (m){m} \cdot \ldots \cdot (x-m,30){x}}} &=&
    \Pstr{ \oview{s} \cdot (m2){m} \cdot (n2-m2,60){x} } \\
 \oview{s \cdot n }  &=&  n
\end{eqnarray*}
where $x$ ranges over variable nodes and  $n$ ranges over non-lambda
nodes without pointer (i.e. $N_@ \union N_\Sigma$).

The pointer associated to $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ in the second
equality and the pointer associated to $m$ in the third equality are
preserved from the left-hand side to the right-hand side of the
equalities.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Alternation and Visibility] \ \\
A justified sequence of nodes $s$ satisfies:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Alternation} if for any two consecutive nodes in $s$, one is a $\lambda$-node
and the other is not;

\item \emph{P-visibility} if every variable node in $s$ points to a node occurring in the P-view a that point;

\item  \emph{O-visibility} if every lambda node in $s$ points to a node occurring in the O-view a that point.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{property}
\label{proper:pview_visibility}
The P-view (resp. O-view) of a justified sequence verifying P-visibility (resp. O-visibility)
is a well-formed justified sequence verifying P-visibility (resp. P-visibility).
\end{property}
This is proved by an easy induction.

\subsection{Adding value-leaves to the computation tree}
\label{sec:adding_value_leaves}

We now add leaves to the computation tree that has been defined in the previous section.
These leaves, called \emph{value-leaves}, are attached to the nodes of the computation tree. Each
value-leaf corresponds to a possible value of the base type $o$.
We write $\mathcal{D}$ to denote the set of values of the base type
$o$. The values leaves are added as follows: every
node $n \in \tau(M)$ has a child leaf denoted by $v_n$ for each possible value $v \in \mathcal{D}$.

%If $n$ is a $\lambda$-node then its value-leaves are numbered from $1$ onwards.
%If $n$ is a variable or constant node then its children nodes are numbered from $1$ to $arity(n)$ and
%its value-leaves are numbered from $arity(n)+1$ onwards.
%If $n$ is an application node then its value-leaves are numbered from $1$ onwards.

Everything that we have defined for computation tree can be lifted
to this new version of computation tree. The node order of a
value-leaf is defined to be $0$. The enabling relation $\vdash$ is
extended so that every leaf is enabled by its parent node. The
definition of justified sequence does not change.
When representing a link in a justified sequence going from a value-leaf $v_n$ to a node $n$,
we label the link with $v$:
$$
\Pstr{ (n){n} \cdot \ldots \cdot (vn-n,40:v){v_n} }
$$

For the definition
of P-view, O-view and visibility, value-leaves are treated as
$\lambda$-nodes if they are at odd level in the computation tree and
as variable nodes if there at a even level.

From now the term ``computation tree'' refers to this extended
definition.
\vspace{10pt}

Let $n$ be a node of a justified sequence of nodes.
If there is an occurrence of a value-leaf $v_n$ in the sequence that points to $n$ we say that
$n$ is \emph{matched} by $v_n$. If there is no value-leaf in the sequence that points to $n$ we
say that $n$ is an \emph{unmatched node}.
The last unmatched node is called the \emph{pending node}.
A justified sequence of nodes is \emph{well-bracketed} if
each value-leaf in the traversal points to the pending node at that point.

If $t$ is a traversal then we write $?(t)$ to denote the subsequence
of $t$ consisting only of unmatched nodes.

\subsection{Traversal of the computation tree}
\label{subsec:traversal}
Intuitively, a \emph{traversal} is a justified sequence of nodes of the computation tree where each node indicates a step that is taken during the evaluation of the term.

\subsubsection{Traversals for simply-typed $\lambda$-terms}
We first define traversals for computation trees of simply typed $\lambda$-terms with no interpreted constants.
We will then we show how to extend the definition to the general setting of $\lambda$-calculus augmented with interpreted constants.

\begin{definition}[Traversals for simply-typed $\lambda$-terms]
\label{def:traversal}
In the simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus without interpreted constants, a traversal over a computation tree $\tau(M)$ is a justified sequence of nodes defined by induction on the rules
given below. A \emph{maximal-traversal} is a traversal that cannot be
extended by any rule. If $T$ denotes a computation tree then we write $\travset(T)$
to denote the set of traversals of $T$. We also use the abbreviation $\travset(M)$ for $\travset(\tau(M))$.

\emph{Initialization rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item ($\epsilon$) The empty sequence of node $\epsilon$ is a traversal.
\item (Root) The length 1 sequence $r$, where $r$ is denotes the root of $\tau(M)$, is a traversal.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Structural rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Lam) Suppose that $t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi}$ is a traversal and $n$ is the only child node of $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ in
the computation tree then
$$t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot n$$
is also a traversal
where $n$ points to the \emph{only} occurrence of its enabler in $\pview{t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi}}$.
(Prop. \ref{prop:pviewtrav_is_path} shows that traversals are well-defined and that indeed $n$'s enabler occurs only once in the P-view at that point).

In particular, if $n$ is a free variable node then $n$ points to the first node of $t$.

\item (App) If $t \cdot @$ is a traversal then so is
$$\Pstr{t \cdot (m){@} \cdot (n-m,60:0){n}}$$

{\it i.e.}~the next visited node is the $0^{th}$ child node of
@: the node corresponding to the operator of the application.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Input-variable rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item (InputVar$^{val}$) If $t = t_1 \cdot x \cdot t_2$ is a traversal where $x \in N^{\upharpoonright r}_{var}$ and $x$ is the pending node in $t$ (i.e. $?(t)=?(t_1) \cdot x$) then for any $v \in \mathcal{D}$,
$\Pstr[0.4cm]{t_1 \cdot (x){x} \cdot t_2 \cdot
(xv-x,25:v){v_x}}$ is a traversal.


\item (InputVar)
If $t = t_1 \cdot x \cdot t_2$ is a traversal where $x \in
N_{var}^{\upharpoonright r}$ and $x$ is the pending node in $t$
(i.e. $?(t)=?(t_1) \cdot x$) then so is $\Pstr[0.4cm]{t_1 \cdot
(m){x} \cdot t_2 \cdot (n-m,25:i){n}}$ for all $\lambda$-node
$n$ whose parent occurs in $\oview{t_1 \cdot x}$, $n$ pointing
to some occurrence of its parent node in $\oview{t_1 \cdot x}$.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Copy-cat rules}
\begin{itemize}
  \item (CCAnswer-@)
  If $\Pstr{t \cdot (app){@} \cdot (lz-app,40:0){\lambda
              \overline{z}} \cdot \ldots \cdot
              (lzv-lz,30:v){v_{\lambda \overline{z}}}}$ is a
              traversal then so is: $\Pstr{t \cdot (app){@}
              \cdot (lz-app:40,0){\lambda \overline{z}} \cdot
              \ldots \cdot (lzv-lz,30:v){v_{\lambda
              \overline{z}}} \cdot (appv-app,30:v){v_@}}$.


  \item (CCAnswer-$\lambda$) If $\Pstr{t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot (x){x} \cdot \ldots \cdot (xv-x,30:v){v_x}}$ is a traversal then so is
   $\Pstr{ t \cdot (lmd){\lambda \overline{\xi}} \cdot (x){x}
              \cdot \ldots \cdot (xv-x,20:v){v_x} \cdot
              (lmdv-lmd,20:v){v_{\lambda \overline{\xi}}}}$.

     \item (CCAnswer-var) If $\Pstr{t \cdot y \cdot (lmd){\lambda \overline{\xi}}
                   \cdot \ldots \cdot (lmdv-lmd,30:v){v_{\lambda
                   \overline{\xi}}}}$ is a traversal, where $y$
                   is a non input-variable node, then the
                   following is also a traversal:
        $$\Pstr{ t \cdot (y){y}
            \cdot (lmd){\lambda \overline{\xi}}
            \cdot \ldots
            \cdot (lmdv-lmd,30:v){v_{\lambda \overline{\xi}}}
            \cdot (yv-y,40:v){v_y}}.$$


\item (Var)
If $t \cdot x_i$ is a traversal where $x_i$ is not an input-variable,
then the rule (Var) permits to visit the node corresponding to the subterm that would be substituted
for $x_i$ if all the $\beta$-redexes occurring in $M$ were reduced.

The binding node $\lambda \overline{x}$ necessarily occurs previously
in the traversal. Since $x$ is not hereditarily justified by the
root, $\lambda \overline{x}$ is not the root of the tree and
therefore its justifier $p$ - which is also its parent node - occurs
immediately before itself it in the traversal. We do a case analysis
on $p$:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose $p$ is an @-node then $\lambda \overline{x}$ is necessarily the first child node of $p$
    and $p$ has exactly $|\overline{x}| + 1$ children nodes:
    $$\pstree[levelsep=7ex]{\TR{\stackrel{\vdots}{@^{[p]}}}}
    {   \pstree[linestyle=dotted,levelsep=4ex]{\TR{\lambda \overline{x}}\treelabel{0}}
            {\TR{x_i }}
        \tree{\lambda \overline{\eta_1}}{\vdots}\treelabel{1}
        \TR[edge=\dotedge]{}
        \tree{\lambda \overline{\eta_i}}{\vdots}\treelabel{i}
        \TR[edge=\dotedge]{}
        \tree{\lambda \overline{\eta_{|x|}}}{\vdots}\treelabel{|x|}
    }
    $$
    In that case, the next step of the traversal is a jump to $\lambda \overline{\eta_i}$ -- the $i$th child of
    @ -- which corresponds to the subterm that would be substituted for $x_i$ if the $\beta$-reduction was
    performed:
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    $$\Pstr{ t' \cdot
            (n){@^{[p]}} \cdot
            (lx){\lambda \overline{x}} \cdot \ldots \cdot
            (x-lx,40:i){x_i} \cdot
            (mi-n,40:i){\lambda \overline{\eta_i}} \cdot \ldots
            \in {\travset(M)}   }
    $$

    \item Suppose $p$ is variable node $y$, then
    necessarily the node $\lambda \overline{x}$ has been added to the traversal $t_{\leq y}$ using the (Var) rule
    (this is proved in proposition \ref{prop:pviewtrav_is_path}(i)).
    Therefore $y$ is substituted by the term $\kappa(\lambda \overline{x})$ during the evaluation of the term
    and we have $\ord{y} = \ord{\lambda \overline{x}}$.

    Consequently, during reduction, the variable $x_i$ is substituted by the subterm represented by
    $\lambda \overline{\eta_i}$ -- the $i$th child node of $y$.
    Hence the following justified sequence is also a traversal:
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    $$\Pstr{ t' \cdot
            (n){y^{[n]}} \cdot
            (lx){\lambda \overline{x}} \cdot \ldots \cdot
            (x-lx,40:i){x_i} \cdot
            (mi-n,40:i){\lambda \overline{\eta_i}} \cdot \ldots
    }
    $$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Note that a traversal always starts with the root of the tree.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Our notions of computation tree and traversal differ slightly from
\cite{OngLics2006}.

Firstly, our computation trees do not have nodes labelled with (uninterpreted) first-order constants. On the other hand, there are nodes which are labelled by free variables of any order. Since uninterpreted constants can be regarded as free variables, we do not lose any expressivity. Also, the traversal rules (InputVar$^{val}$) and (InputVar) provide a more general version of the (Sig) rule of \cite{OngLics2006} that models free variables and not just ``constructor'' constants.

Secondly we have introduced copy-cat rules that permit to visit the
value-leaves of the computation tree. The presence of value-leaves
is necessary to model free variables as well as the interpreted
constants present in extensions of the $\lambda$-calculus such as
\pcf\ or \ialgol.
\end{remark}

\begin{exmp}
Consider the following computation tree:
$$\tree{\lambda}
{
    \tree{@}
    {
        \pstree[levelsep=8ex,linestyle=dotted]{\TR{\lambda y}\treelabel{0} }
        {
            \pstree[levelsep=8ex]{\TR{y}}
            {
                \tree{\lambda \overline{\eta_1}}{\vdots} \treelabel{1}
                \TR[edge=\dotedge]{}
                \tree{\lambda \overline{\eta_i}}{\vdots}\treelabel{i}
                \TR[edge=\dotedge]{}
                \tree{\lambda \overline{\eta_n}}{\vdots}\treelabel{n}
            }
        }
        \pstree[levelsep=6ex,linestyle=dotted]{\TR{\lambda \overline{x}}\treelabel{1}}{ \tree{x_i}{\TR{} \TR{} } }
    }
}
$$
An example of traversal of this tree is:
\vspace{0.3cm}
$$ \Pstr{ \lambda \cdot
            (app){@}  \cdot
            (ly){\lambda y} \cdot \ldots \cdot
            (y-ly,40:1){y} \cdot
            (lx-app,50:1){\lambda \overline{x}} \cdot \ldots \cdot
            (x-lx,40:i){x_i} \cdot
            (leta-y,50:i){\lambda \overline{\eta_i} } \cdot \ldots
        }$$
\end{exmp}

\subsubsection{Traversals for interpreted constants}

\begin{definition}[Well-behaved traversal rule]
\label{def:wellbehaved_traversal}
A traversal rule is \emph{well-behaved} if it can be stated under the following form:
$$\rulef{t = t_1\cdot n \cdot t_2 \in \travset \quad ?(t) = ?(t_1) \cdot n \quad P(t)}
  { \stackrel{  \rule{0pt}{3pt} }{\Pstr[5pt]{ t' = t_1\cdot (n){n} \cdot t_2 \cdot (m-n,35){m} \in \travset}}
   }
    \ m\in S(t)
   $$
such that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $n$ is a variable or a constant node;
  \item $P$ expresses some condition on $t$;
  \item $S(t)$ is some subset of $E(n)$, the set of children $\lambda$-nodes and value-leaves of $n$.
  If $S(t)$ has more than one element then the rule is non-deterministic.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Note that if $t$ is well-bracketed then $t'$ is also well-bracketed
and if $?(t)$ satisfies alternation (resp. visibility) then so does $?(t')$.


\begin{exmp} The rule (InputVar$^{val}$) is an example of non-deterministic well-behaved traversal rule for which $S(t)$ is exactly the set of all children value-leaves of $n$:
$S(t) = \{ v_n \ | \ v \in \mathcal{D} \} $.
However (InputVar) is not well-behaved since it can jump to any node in the O-view at that point and not necessarily to a children node of the last pending node.
\end{exmp}

In the presence of higher-order interpreted constants, additional rules must be specified to indicate how
the constant nodes should be traversed in the computation tree. These rules
are specific to the language that is being studied.
In the last section of this chapter we will define such traversals for the interpreted constants of
\pcf\ and \ialgol.

From now on, we consider a simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus language extended with
higher-order interpreted constants for which some constant traversal rules have been defined
and we take the following condition as a prerequisite:
\begin{center}
  \textbf{(Condition WB)} The constant traversal rules are well-behaved.
\end{center}


\subsubsection{Some properties of traversals}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:pviewtrav_is_path}
Let $t$ be a traversal. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $t$ is a well-defined and well-bracketed justified sequence;
\item[(ii)] $?(t)$ is a well-defined justified sequence verifying alternation, P-visibility and O-visibility;
\item[(iii)] $\pview{?(t)}$ is the path in the computation tree going from the root to the last node in $?(t)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
This is the counterpart of proposition 6 from
\cite{OngHoMchecking2006} which is proved by induction on the
traversal rules. This proof can be easily adapted to take into
account the constant rules (using the assumption that constants
rules are well-behaved) and the presence of value-leaves in the
traversal.
\begin{proof}
The proof of (i), (ii) and (iii) is done simultaneously by induction on the traversal rules. We consider the rules (Var) and (Lam) only.

Rule (Var): we just give a partial proof of (i). See proposition 6 from \cite{OngHoMchecking2006} for the details of (i), (ii) and (iii). We have to show that in the second case of the (Var) rule, where $p$ is a variable node $y$, the node $\lambda \overline{x}$ has necessarily been added to the traversal $t_{\leq y}$ using the (Var) rule. This is immediate since if the rule (InputVar) was used to produce $t_{<y} \cdot y \cdot \lambda \overline{x}$ this would imply that $\lambda \overline{x}$ is hereditarily justified by the root which in turn implies that $x_i$ is an input-variable. Hence reaching a contradiction.

Rule (Lam): we need to show that $n$'s enabler occurs only once in the P-view at that point. By the induction hypothesis we have (by (iii)) that $\pview{?(t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi})}$ is a path in the computation tree from the root to $\lambda \overline{\xi}$. $n$'s enabler occurs only once in this path: it is precisely it's binding node. Therefore the traversal $t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot n$ is well-defined and $?(t \cdot \lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot n)$ satisfies P-visibility i.e.\ we have proved (i) and (ii). Since $n$ is a child of $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ we also have (iii).
\end{proof}

%In particular to prove that the copy-cat rules are well-defined, one needs to ensure that
%if the last two unmatched nodes are $y$ and $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ in that order, for some non input-variable node $y$ then necessary
%      $y$ and $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ are consecutive nodes in the traversal.
%    This is because in a traversal, a non input-variable $y$ is always followed by a lambda node and whenever this lambda node is answered
%    there is only one way to extend the traversal : by using the copy cat rule to answer the $y$ node.


\begin{definition}[Traversal reduction]
Let $r$ be the root of the computation tree. We say that the
justified sequence of nodes \emph{$s$ is a reduction of the
traversal $t$} just when $s = t \upharpoonright r$.
\end{definition}

Since @-nodes and $\Sigma$-constants do not have pointers, the
reduction of traversal contains only nodes in $N_\lambda \union
N_{var}$.


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:var_followedby_child} Let $M$ be a term in $\beta$-normal
form and $t$ be a traversal of $\tau(M)$. If
$\Pstr{ ?(t) = u_1 \cdot (m){m} \cdot u_2 \cdot (n-m,30){n} }$
 where $m \in (N_{var} \union N_{\Sigma}) \setminus (N^{\upharpoonright r}_{var} \union N^{\upharpoonright r}_{\Sigma})$
then $u_2 = \epsilon$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By case analysis on the rule used to visit the node
$n$ in $t$. The only relevant rules are (Var), (CCAnswer-var), (InputVar$^{val}$), (InputVar)
and the constant rules.
Since the term is in $\beta$-normal form, there is no @-node in $\tau(M)$ and therefore (Var) cannot be used.
Since $m$ is not hereditarily justified by the root, it is not an input-variable and therefore the rules
(InputVar$^{val}$) and (InputVar) cannot be used.
For the rule (CCAnswer-var) the result follows from the well-bracketedness of traversals.
For constant rules, the result follows from the well-behaviour of constant rules (condition WB).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[View of a traversal reduction]
\label{lem:redtrav_trav} Suppose that $M$ is a $\beta$-normal term and $t$ is a traversal of $\tau(M)$ then
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $ \pview{?(t) \upharpoonright  r } = \pview{?(t)} \upharpoonright r$\ ;
\item[(ii)] if the last node in $t$ is hereditarily justified by $r$ then $ \oview{?(t) \upharpoonright r } = \oview{?(t)}$\ .
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
(i) By induction. It is trivially true for the empty
traversal. Step case: consider a traversal $t$ and
suppose that the property (i) is verified for all traversal shorter
than $t$. There are three cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $?(t) = t' \cdot r$ then we have:
    \begin{align*}
    \pview{?(t)} \upharpoonright  r
        &=  \pview{t' \cdot r } \upharpoonright  r       & (\mbox{def. of } ?(t))\\
        &=  r \upharpoonright  r                         & (\mbox{def. P-view})\\
        &=  r                                                & (\mbox{def. operator $\upharpoonright$})\\
        &=  \pview{(t' \upharpoonright  r ) \cdot r }    & (\mbox{def. P-view})\\
        &=  \pview{(t' \cdot r)  \upharpoonright  r }    & (\mbox{def. operator $\upharpoonright$})\\
        &= \pview{?(t) \upharpoonright  r }                & (\mbox{def. of } ?(t))
    \end{align*}

\item If $?(t) = t' \cdot n$ with $n \in N_{var} \union N_{\Sigma}$ then:
    \begin{align*}
    \pview{?(t)} \upharpoonright  r
&= \pview{t' \cdot n} \upharpoonright  r & (\mbox{definition of } ?(t))\\
        &= (\pview{t'} \cdot n) \upharpoonright  r  & (\mbox{P-view computation}) \\
        &= \pview{t'} \upharpoonright  r  \cdot (n \upharpoonright  r)            & (\mbox{def. of filtering $\upharpoonright$}) \\
        &= \pview{t' \upharpoonright  r } \cdot (n \upharpoonright  r)           & (\mbox{induction hypothesis}) \\
        &= \pview{t' \upharpoonright  r \cdot (n \upharpoonright  r) } & (\mbox{P-view computation, $n \in N_{var} \union N_{\Sigma}$}) \\
        &= \pview{(t' \cdot n ) \upharpoonright  r  }           & (\mbox{def. of filtering $\upharpoonright$}) \\
        &= \pview{?(t) \upharpoonright  r  }
 & (\mbox{definition of } ?(t))
    \end{align*}


\item If $\Pstr{ ?(t) =  t' \cdot (m){m} \cdot  u \cdot (lmd-m,30){n}}$ with $n\in N_\lambda \setminus N^{\upharpoonright r}_\lambda$ then we have $u = \epsilon$ by lemma
    \ref{lem:var_followedby_child} and:
        \begin{align*}
        \pview{?(t)} \upharpoonright  r
        &= \pview{\Pstr{t' \cdot (m){m} \cdot (n-m,60){n}}} \upharpoonright  r
                                                        & (u=\epsilon)\\
        &= (\Pstr{\pview{t'} \cdot (m){m} \cdot (lmd-m,60){n}} ) \upharpoonright  r
                                                        & (\mbox{P-view computation}) \\
        &= \pview{t'} \upharpoonright  r                & (m, n \not\in N^{\upharpoonright r}) \\
        &= \pview{t' \upharpoonright  r }               & \mbox{(induction hypothesis)} \\
        &= \pview{ (\Pstr{t' \cdot (m){m} \cdot (lmd-m,40){n}}) \upharpoonright r }
                                                        & (m, n \not\in N^{\upharpoonright r}) \\
        &= \pview{ ?(t) \upharpoonright r }             & \mbox{(def. of $?(t)$ \& $u = \epsilon$)}
        \end{align*}

\item If $\Pstr{ ?(t) =  t' \cdot (m){m} \cdot u \cdot (lmd-m,30){n} }$ with $n\in N^{\upharpoonright r}_\lambda$ then:
        \begin{align*}

        &= \pview{ ?(t) \upharpoonright r }                & \mbox{(def. of $?(t)$)}
        \end{align*}
\end{itemize}
(ii) By a straightforward induction similar to (i).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Traversal of $\beta$-normal terms]
\label{lem:betaeta_trav}
Let $M$ be a $\beta$-normal term, $r$ be the root of the tree $\tau(M)$ and
$t$ be a traversal of $\tau(M)$.
For any node $n$ occurring in $t$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
r \mbox{ does not hereditarily justify } n  \  \iff \   n \mbox{ is
hereditarily justified by some node in } N_\Sigma.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 In a computation tree, the only nodes that do not have justification pointer are:
the root $r$, @-nodes and $\Sigma$-constant nodes. But since $M$ is
in $\beta$-normal form, there is no @-node in the computation tree.
Hence nodes are either hereditarily justified by $r$ or hereditarily
justified by a node in $N_\Sigma$. Moreover $r$ is not in $N_\Sigma$
therefore the ``or'' is exclusive : a node cannot be hereditarily
justified at the same time by $r$ and by some node in $N_\Sigma$.
\end{proof}


\section{Game semantics correspondence}
\label{sec:gamesemcorresp}

 We are working in the general setting of an applied
simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus with a given set of higher-order
constants $\Sigma$. The operational semantics of these constants is
given by certain reduction rules. We assume that a fully abstract
model of the calculus is provided by means of a category of
well-bracketed games. For instance, suppose that $\Sigma$ consists
of the set of \pcf\ constants then we consider the traditional
category of games and innocent well-bracketed strategies
\cite{hylandong_pcf,abramsky94full}.

We choose to represent strategies by a prefix-closed set instead of
an ``even length prefix''-closed set. This permits us to avoid
considerations on the parity of the length of traversals when
proving the correspondence between traversals and game semantics. We
write $\sem{\Gamma \vdash M : A}$ for the strategy denoting the
simply-typed term $\Gamma \vdash M : A$ and $\prefset(S)$ to denote
the prefix-closure of the set $S$.


\subsection{Relationship between computation trees and arenas}

\subsubsection{Example}
Consider the following term $M \equiv \lambda f z . (\lambda g x . f (f x)) (\lambda y. y) z$ of type $(o \typear o) \typear o \typear o$.
Its $\eta$-long normal form is $\lambda f z . (\lambda g x . f (f x)) (\lambda y. y) (\lambda .z)$.
The computation tree is:

$$
\tree{\lambda f z}
{ \tree{@}
    {
        \tree{\lambda g x}
            { \tree{f}{   \tree{\lambda}{ \tree{f}{  \tree{\lambda}{\TR{x}}} }  }
            }
        \tree{\lambda y}{\TR{y}}
        \tree{\lambda}{\TR{z}}
    }
}
$$

The arena for the type $(o \typear o) \typear o \typear o$ is:
$$\tree{q^1}
{
    \tree{q^3}
        {  \tree{q^4}
                {\TR{a^4_1} \TR{\ldots}}
            \TR{a^3_1} \TR{\ldots} }
    \tree{q^2}
    { \TR{a^2_1} \TR{a^2_2}\TR{\ldots} }
    \TR{a_1} \TR{a_2}\TR{\ldots}
}
$$

\newlength{\yNull}
\def\bow{\quad\psarc{->}(0,\yNull){1.5ex}{90}{270}}

The figure below represents the computation tree (left) and the
arena (right). The dashed line defines a partial function $\varphi$
from the set of nodes in the computation tree to the set of moves.
For simplicity, we now omit answers moves when representing arenas.
$$
\tree{ \Rnode{root} {\lambda f z}^{[1]} }
     {  \tree{@^{[2]}}

                }
            \tree{\lambda y ^{[4]}}{\TR{y}}
            \tree{\lambda ^{[5]}}{\TR{\Rnode{z}z}}
        }
    }
\hspace{3cm}
  \tree[levelsep=12ex]{ \Rnode{q1}q^1 }
    {   \pstree[levelsep=4ex]{\TR{\Rnode{q3}q^3}}{\TR{\Rnode{q4}q^4}}

$$

Consider the justified sequence of moves $s \in \sem{M}$:
 $$s = \Pstr[0.2cm][5pt]{(q1){q}^1\ (q3-q1,60){q}^3\ (q4-q3,60){q}^4\ (q3b-q1){q}^3\ (q4b-q3b,60){q}^4\ (q2-q1,30){q}^2 }
\in \sem{M}$$

There is a corresponding justified sequence of nodes in the computation tree:
\vspace{0.5cm}
$$r = \Pstr{
        (q1){\lambda f z} \cdot
        (q3-q1,60){f}^{[6]} \cdot
        (q4-q3,60){\lambda^{[7]}} \cdot
        (q3b-q1,60){f}^{[8]} \cdot
        (q4b-q3b,50){\lambda^{[9]}} \cdot
        (q2-q1,50){z} }$$
such that $s_i = \varphi(r_i)$ for all $i < |s|$.

The sequence $r$ is in fact the reduction of the following
traversal: \vspace*{1cm}
$$t = \Pstr{ (q1){\lambda f z} \cdot
            (n2){@^{[2]}} \cdot (n3-n2,60){\lambda g x^{[3]}} \cdot
            (q3-q1,60){f}^{[6]} \cdot (q4-q3,60){\lambda^{[7]}} \cdot
            (q3b-q1,40){f}^{[8]} \cdot (q4b-q3b,70){\lambda^{[9]}} \cdot
            (n8-n3,35){x^{[10]}} \cdot
            (n9-n2,30){\lambda^{[5]}} \cdot
            (q2-q1,35){z} }
$$

By representing side-by-side the computation tree and the type arena of a term in $\eta$-normal form we have observed
that some nodes of the computation tree can be mapped to question moves of the arena.
In the next section, we show how to define this mapping in a systematic manner.

\subsubsection{Formal definition}

Let us establish precisely the relationship between arenas of the
game semantics and the computation trees. Let $\Gamma \vdash M : A$
be a term in $\eta$-long normal form. The computation tree $\tau(M)$
is represented by a pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices of
the trees and $E$ is the edges relation. $V = N \union L$ where $N$
is the set of nodes and $L$ is the set of value-leaves.
The relation $E \subseteq V \times V$ gives the parent-child relation on the vertices of the tree.
We write $V_\$$ for $N_\$ \union (E(N_\$) \inter L)$ where $\$$ ranges over $\{@, var, \Sigma, fv \}$.


Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the set of values of the base type $o$. If $n$ is a node in $N$ then the value-leaves attached to the node $n$ are written $v_n$ where $v$ ranges in $\mathcal{D}$.
Similarly, if $q$ is a question in $\sem{A}$ then the answer moves enabled by $q$ are written $v_q$ where $v$ ranges in $\mathcal{D}$.

If $A$ is an arena and $q$ is a move in $A$ then we write $A_q$ to
denote the subarena of $A$ rooted at $q$.

\begin{definition}[Mapping from nodes to moves]
\label{def:phi_procedure}
For any term $\Gamma \vdash M :T$, we define a function $\psi_M^{n,q}$ where the parameter $n$ is a node of the computation tree $\tau(M)$ and the parameter $q$ is a question move of the arena $\sem{T}$ such that $q$ and $n$ are of type $(A_1. \ldots A_p, o)$ for some $p\geq 0$.
Let $\vdash( q ) = \{ q^1, \ldots, q^p \} \union \{  v_q : v \in \mathcal{D} \}$.

The function $\psi_N^{n,q}$ from $V^{\upharpoonright n}$ to $\sem{T}$ is defined as follows:
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item[case 1] If $p=0$ ($n$ is labelled with $\lambda$ or with a ground type variable) then
        $$\psi_M^{n,q} = \{ n \mapsto q \} \quad \union \quad  \{ v_n \mapsto v_q \ | \ v \in \mathcal{D} \}$$

\item[case 2]  If $p\geq 1$ and $n \in N_{\lambda}$ with $n$ labelled $\lambda \overline{\xi} = \lambda \xi_1 \ldots \xi_p$ and with a child node labelled $\alpha$ then the computation tree and the arena $\sem{T}$ have the following forms (value-leaves and answer moves are not represented for simplicity):
    $$ \tree{ \Rnode{r}\lambda \overline{\xi}  ^{[n]}}
        {
            \tree[levelsep=6ex]{\alpha}
            {   \TR{\ldots} \TR{\ldots} \TR{\ldots}
            }
        }
    \hspace{3cm}
    \tree{ \Rnode{q0}q }
        {
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{q^1}{\TR{} \TR{} }
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{q^2}{\TR{} \TR{} }
            \TR{\ldots}
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{q^p}{\TR{} \TR{} }
        }
    \psset{nodesep=1pt,arrows=->,arcangle=-20,arrowsize=2pt 1,linestyle=dashed,linewidth=0.3pt}
    \ncline{->}{r}{q0}
    \ncarc{->}{q2}{z}
    \ncline{->}{q3}{f}
    \ncline{->}{q4}{lmd}
    \ncline{->}{q3}{f2}
    \ncline{->}{q4}{lmd2}
    $$

    For each abstracted variable $\xi_i$ there exists a corresponding question move $q^i$ of the same order in the arena. $\psi_M^{n,q}$ maps each free occurrence of a variable $\xi_i$ to the corresponding move $q^i$:
    $$
    \psi_M^{n,q} =  \{ n \mapsto q \} \quad  \union \quad  \{ v_n \mapsto v_q \ | \ v \in \mathcal{D} \}
                      \quad \union \quad  \Union_{\displaystyle m \in N | n \vdash_i m} \psi_M^{m, q^i}$$

\item[case 3] If $p\geq 1$ and $n\in N_{var}$ then $n$ is labelled with a variable $x:(A_1,\ldots,A_p,o)$
with children nodes $\lambda \overline{\eta}_1$, \ldots, $\lambda \overline{\eta}_p$. The computation tree $\tau(M)$ and the arena $\sem{T}$ have the following forms:
    $$\tree{\Rnode{r}{x^{[n]}}}
        {   \tree{\TR{\lambda \overline{\eta}_1}}{\vdots} \TR{\ldots}
        \tree{\TR{\lambda \overline{\eta}_p }}{\vdots}
        }
    \hspace{3cm}
    \tree{ \Rnode{q0}q }
        {
\tree[linestyle=dotted]{\Rnode{q1}{q^1}}{\TR{} \TR{} }
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{\Rnode{q2}{q^2}}{\TR{} \TR{} }
            \TR{\ldots}
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{\Rnode{qp}{q^p}}{\TR{} \TR{} }
        }
    \psset{nodesep=1pt,arrows=->,arcangle=-20,arrowsize=2pt 1,linestyle=dashed,linewidth=0.3pt}
    \ncline{->}{r}{q0}
    \ncarc{->}{q2}{z}
    \ncline{->}{q3}{f}
    \ncline{->}{q4}{lmd}
    \ncline{->}{q3}{f2}
    \ncline{->}{q4}{lmd2}
    $$

    $\psi_M^{n,q}$ maps each child node of $n$ to the corresponding question move $q^i$ of the same type
in the arena $\sem{T}$:
    $$\psi_M^{n,q} =
         \{ n \mapsto q \} \quad \union\quad \{ v_n \mapsto v_q \ | \ v \in \mathcal{D}   \} \quad\union\quad     \Union_{i=1..m} \psi_M^{ \lambda \overline{\eta}_i, q^i}
    $$
\end{itemize}

Note that $\psi_M^{n,q}$ is only a partial function from $V$ to $A$ since it is defined only
on nodes that are hereditarily justified by the root but not hereditarily justified by a free variable node. In other words, $\psi_M^{n,q}$ is undefined on nodes that are hereditarily justified by $N_{fv} \union N_@ \union N_\Sigma$.
\end{definition}

We write $\mathcal{M}_M$ to denote the following disjoint union of arenas:
$$\mathcal{M}_M = \sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T} \quad \uplus \quad  \biguplus_{n \in N \inter E\relimg{N_@ \union N_\Sigma} } \sem{type(\kappa(n))}.$$

Moves in $\mathcal{M}_M$ are implicitly tagged so it is possible to recover the arena in which they belong.


\begin{definition}[Total mapping from nodes to moves]
For a closed simply-typed term $\vdash M : T$
we define the total function $\varphi_M : V_\lambda \union V_{var} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}_M$ as:
\begin{align*}
\varphi_M =
        \psi_{\sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T}}^{r, q^0_{\sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T}}} \quad
    \union \quad
        \Union_{n \in N \inter E \relimg{N_@ \union N_\Sigma}}  \psi_{\sem{type(\kappa(n))}}^{n, q^0_{\sem{type(\kappa(n))}}} )
\end{align*}
where $q^0_A$ denotes the only initial question of the arena $A$ (arenas involved in the game semantics of simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus have a single  root).

For an open term $\Gamma \vdash M : T$
with $\Gamma = x_1:X_1 \ldots x_p : X_p$ we define
$\varphi_M$ as $\varphi_{\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n . M}$.

When there is no ambiguity we omit the subscript in $\varphi_M$.
\end{definition}

Nodes of $\tau(M)$ are either hereditarily justified by the root, by
a @-node or by a $\Sigma$-node, therefore $\varphi_M$ is totally
defined on $V_\lambda \union V_{var} = V\setminus (V_@ \union
V_\Sigma)$.

\begin{exmp}
Consider the term $\lambda x . (\lambda g . g x) (\lambda y . y)$ with $x,y:o$ and $g:(o,o)$.
The diagram below represents the computation tree (middle), the arenas
$\sem{(o,o)\rightarrow o}$ (left), $\sem{o \rightarrow o}$ (right), $\sem{o\rightarrow o}$ (rightmost)
and the function $\varphi = f(\lambda x, q_{\lambda x}) \union f(\lambda g, q_{\lambda g}) \union f(\lambda y, q_{\lambda y})$

The following properties are immediate consequences of the definition of the procedure $f$:
\begin{property} \
\label{proper:phi_conserve_order}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $\varphi$ maps $\lambda$-nodes to O-questions, variable nodes to
P-questions, value-leaves of $\lambda$-nodes to P-answers and
value-leaves of variable nodes to O-answers;
\item[(ii)] $\varphi$ maps nodes of a given order to moves of the same order.
\end{itemize}
\end{property}
Remark: we recall that in definition \ref{def:nodeorder}, the
node-order is defined differently for the root $\lambda$-node and
other $\lambda$-nodes. This convention was chosen to guarantee that
property (ii) holds.

By extension, the function $\varphi$ is also defined on justified
sequences of nodes: if $t = t_0 t_1 \ldots$ is a justified sequence
of nodes in $V_\lambda \union V_{var}$ then $\varphi(t)$ is defined
to be the following sequence of moves:
$$\varphi(t) = \varphi(t_0)\ \varphi(t_1)\  \varphi(t_2) \ldots$$
where the pointers of $\varphi(t)$ are defined to be exactly those
of $t$. This definition implies that $\varphi : (V_\lambda \union
V_{var})^* \rightarrow \mathcal{M}^*$ regarded as a function from
pointer-less sequences of nodes to pointer-less sequences of moves
is a monoid homomorphism.

\begin{property}
\label{proper:phi_pview} Let $t$ be a justified sequence of nodes. The following properties hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $\varphi(t)$ and $t$ have the same pointers;
\item[(ii)] the P-view of $\varphi(t)$ and the P-view of $t$ are computed
identically: the set of indices of elements that must be removed
from both sequences in order to obtain their P-view is the same;
\item[(iii)] the O-view of $\varphi(t)$ and the O-view of $t$ are computed identically;
\item[(iv)] if $t$ is a justified sequence of nodes in $V_\lambda \union V_{var}$ then $?(\varphi(t)) =
\varphi(?(t))$,
\end{itemize}
where $?(\varphi(t))$ denotes the subsequence of $\varphi(t)$ consisting of the unanswered questions
and $?(t)$ denotes the subsequence of $t$ consisting of the unmatched nodes (see the
definition in section \ref{sec:adding_value_leaves}).
\end{property}
\begin{proof}
(i): By definition of $\varphi$, $t$ and $\varphi(t)$ have the same
pointers;

(ii) and (iii): $\varphi$ maps lambda nodes to O-question,
non-lambda nodes to P-question, value-leaves of lambda nodes to P-answers and
value-leaves of non-lambda to O-answers. Therefore since $t$ and $\varphi(t)$ have the
same pointers, the computations of the P-view (resp. O-view) of the
sequence of moves and the P-view (resp. O-view) of the sequence of
nodes follow the same steps;

(iv) is a consequence of (i).

\end{proof}


\subsection{Interaction games}
\label{sec:interaction_semantics}

In game semantics, strategy composition is achieved by performing a
CSP-like ``composition + hiding''. It is possible to define an
alternative semantics where the internal moves are not hidden when
performing composition. This semantics is named \emph{revealed semantics} in \cite{willgreenlandthesis} and \emph{interaction}
semantics in \cite{DBLP:conf/sas/DimovskiGL05}.

In addition to the moves of the standard semantics, the interaction semantics contains certain
internal moves of the computation.
Consequently, the interaction semantics depends on the syntactical structure of the term and therefore cannot
lead to a full abstraction result. However this semantics will prove to be useful to identify
a correspondence between the game semantics
of a term and the traversals of its computation tree.

Our interaction semantics will be calculated from the
$\eta$-normal form of a term. However we do not want to keep all the internal moves: we only keep the internal
moves that are produced when composing two subterms of the computation tree joint by an @-node.
This means that when computing the strategy denoting
$y N_1 \ldots N_p$ where $y$ is a variable, we preserve the internal moves of $N_1$, \ldots, $N_p$ while
omitting the internal moves produced by the copy-cat projection strategy denoting $y$.

\begin{definition} \
\begin{itemize}
\item We call \defname{interaction type tree} or just \defname{interaction type},
a tree whose leaves are labelled with linear simple types and
nodes are labelled with symbol in $\{ ;, \langle \_\ ,\_
\rangle, \otimes, \dagger, \Lambda \}$.


Nodes labelled $;$, $\langle \_\ ,\_ \rangle$ or $\otimes$ are
binary nodes and nodes labelled $\dagger$ or $\Lambda$ are unary
nodes. If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are interaction types we write
$\langle T_1, T_2 \rangle$ to denote the interaction type
obtained by attaching $T_1$ and $T_2$ to a $\langle \_\ ,\_
\rangle$-node. Similarly we use the notations $T_1 \otimes T_2$,
$T_1 ; T_2$, $\Lambda(T_1)$ and $T_1^\dagger$.

\item To every node or leaf we can associate a linear type. We write
    $type(T)$ to denote the type associated to the root node. We
    sometime write the type in exponent {\it e.g.}
    $T^{A\rightarrow B}$ if $type(T) =A\rightarrow B$. This type
    is determined by the structure of the tree as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If $T$ is a leaf then $type(T)$ is define as the type that labels the leaf;

    \item $type\ (T^{!A \multimap B})^\dagger = !A \multimap !B$;

    \item $type\ \Lambda(T_1^{A \otimes B \multimap C}) = A \multimap (B \multimap C)$

    \item $type\ \langle T_1^{C \multimap A} , T_2^{C \multimap B} \rangle =
    C \multimap A \times B$;

    \item $type\ T_1^{A \multimap B} \otimes T_2^{C \multimap D} = (A \otimes C) \multimap (B \otimes D)$;

    \item $type\ T_1^{A \multimap B};T_2^{B \multimap C} = A \multimap C$.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

For the interaction type tree to be well-defined, it is required
that types of children nodes are consistent with the meaning of the
parent node; for instance the two children nodes of a ;-node must be
of type $A\multimap B$ and $B\multimap C$.

\end{definition}


Let $T$ be an interaction type tree. Each leaf or node of type $A$
in $T$ can be mapped to the (standard) game $\sem{A}$. By taking the
image of $T$ across this mapping we obtain a tree whose leaves and
nodes are labelled by games. This tree, written $\intersem{T}$, is
called an \defname{interaction game}.

A \defname{revealed strategy} $\Sigma$ on the interaction game $\intersem{T}$ is a compositions of several standard strategies in which certain internal moves are not hidden. Formally:
\begin{definition}[Revealed strategy]
A revealed strategy $\Sigma$ on an interaction game $\intersem{T}$,
written $\Sigma: \intersem{T}$, is an annotated interaction type
tree $T$ where
\begin{itemize}
\item each leaf $\sem{A}$ of $T$ is annotated with a (standard) strategy $\sigma$ on the game
$\sem{A}$;
\item each $;$-node is annotated with a set of indices $U \subseteq \nat$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The intuition behind this definition is that each $;$-node with children of type $A\multimap B$ and $B\multimap C$ is annotated with a set of indices $U$ indicating which components of $B$ should be uncovered when performing composition.
More precisely, if $B = B_0 \times \ldots \times B_l$ then the revealed strategy built by connecting two revealed strategies $\Sigma_1 : \intersem{A\multimap B}$ and $\Sigma_2 : \intersem{B\multimap C}$
using a $;$-node annotated with $U$ represents the
set of uncovered plays obtained
by performing the usual composition while ignoring and copying the internal moves already in $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ and preserving any internal
move produced by the composition in some component $B_k$ for $k \in U$.

\begin{exmp}
The diagrams below represent an interaction type tree $T$ (left),
the corresponding interaction game $\intersem{T}$ (middle) and a
revealed strategy $\Sigma$ (right):
$$
\pstree[levelsep=6ex]{\TR{;}}
        {
            \pstree[levelsep=6ex]{\TR{;}}
            { \TR{A\multimap B}
              \TR{B\multimap C}
            }
            \TR{C\multimap D}
        }
\hspace{1cm}
\pstree[levelsep=6ex]{\TR{;}}
        {
            \pstree[levelsep=6ex]{\TR{;}}
            { \TR{\sem{A\multimap B}}
              \TR{\sem{B\multimap C}}
            }
            \TR{\sem{C\multimap D}}
        }
\hspace{1cm}
\pstree[levelsep=6ex]{\TR{;^{\{0\}}}}
        {
            \pstree[levelsep=6ex]{\TR{;^{\{0\}}}}
            { \TR{A\multimap B^{\sigma_1}}
              \TR{B\multimap C^{\sigma_2}}
            }
            \TR{C\multimap D^{\sigma_3}}
        }
$$
\end{exmp}
A revealed strategy can also be written as an expression, for
instance the strategy represented above is given by the expression
$\Sigma = (\sigma_1 ;^{\{0\}} \sigma_2) ;^{\{0\}} \sigma_3$. We will
use the abbreviation $\Sigma_1 \fatsemi^U \Sigma_2$ for
$\Sigma_1^\dagger ; ^U \Sigma_2$.


\subsubsection{Uncovered play}

The analogous of a play in the interaction semantics is called an
\emph{uncovered play}, it is a play containing internal moves. The
moves are implicitly tagged so that it is possible to retrieve in
which component of the arena of which node/leaf-game the move
belongs to. A given move may belong to several games from different
nodes/leaves of the interaction game.

\begin{definition}
The \defname{set of possible moves} $M_T$ of an interaction game
$\intersem{T}$ is defined as $\mathcal{M}_T/\hspace{-0.5em}\sim_T$,
the quotient of the set $\mathcal{M}_T$ by the equivalence relation
$\sim_T \subseteq \mathcal{M}_T \times \mathcal{M}_T$ defined as follows:
For a single leaf tree $T$ labelled by a type $A$ we define
$\mathcal{M}_T = M_A$ and $\sim_T = id_{M_A}$. For other cases:
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{M}_{T^\dagger} &= \mathcal{M}_{T} + \mathcal{M}_{type(T^\dagger)}
    &
        \mathcal{M}_{\Lambda(T)} &= \mathcal{M}_{T} + \mathcal{M}_{type(\Lambda(T))}
    \\
        \sim_{T^\dagger} &= \left( \sim_{T}
        \union \left(type\ T^\dagger \leftrightarrow  type\ T\right)
        \right)^\star
    &
        \sim_{\Lambda(T)} &= \left( \sim_{T}
        \union \left(type\ \Lambda(T) \leftrightarrow type\ T\right)
        \right)^\star
    \end{align*}
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal{M}_{\langle T_1^{C^1 \multimap A^1}, T_2^{C^2 \multimap B^2}\rangle}
        &= \mathcal{M}_{T_1} + \mathcal{M}_{T_2} + \mathcal{M}_{C \multimap (A \otimes B)}
    \\
         \sim_{\langle T_1^{C^1 \multimap A^1}, T_2^{C^2 \multimap B^2}\rangle} &= \left( \sim_{T_1}
        \union \sim_{T_2} \union (C^1 \leftrightarrow C) \union (C^2 \leftrightarrow C)
        \union (A^1 \leftrightarrow A) \union (B^2 \leftrightarrow B)
        \right)^\star
    \\
    \\
        \mathcal{M}_{T_1^{A^1 \multimap B^1}\otimes T_2^{C^2 \multimap D^2}} &= \mathcal{M}_{T_1} +  \mathcal{M}_{T_2} + \mathcal{M}_{A \otimes C \multimap B \otimes D }
        \\
         \sim_{T_1^{A^1 \multimap B^1}\otimes T_2^{C^2 \multimap D^2}} &= \left( \sim_{T_1}
        \union \sim_{T_2} \union (A^1 \leftrightarrow A)
        \union (B^1 \leftrightarrow B) \union (C^2 \leftrightarrow C)\union (D^2 \leftrightarrow D)
        \right)^\star
    \\
    \\
        \mathcal{M}_{T_1^{A \multimap B};T_2^{B \multimap C}} &=
            \mathcal{M}_{T_1} + \mathcal{M}_{T_2} + \mathcal{M}_{A\multimap C}
        \\
         \sim_{T_1^{A^1 \multimap B^1};T_2^{B^2 \multimap C^2}} &= \left( \sim_{T_1}
        \union \sim_{T_2} \union (A^1 \leftrightarrow A)
        \union (B^1 \leftrightarrow B^2) \union (C \leftrightarrow C^2)
        \right)^\star
    \end{align*}
    where $A\leftrightarrow B$ denotes the implicit bijection between
    two isomorphic arenas $\sem{A}$ and $\sem{B}$; $R^\star$
    denotes the smallest superset of the relation $R$ complete
    by transitivity, reflexivity and symmetry.
\end{definition}

The set of \defname{internal moves} of the game $\intersem{T}$, consists of all moves from $M_T$ that are not
$\sim$-equivalent to any move in $M_{type(T)}$.


A \defname{justified interaction sequence} of moves on the
interaction game $\intersem{T}$ is a sequence of moves from $M_T$
together with pointers. In contrast to the standard notion of
justified sequence, to each move in the sequence can be attached
several pointers. More precisely, if the equivalence class $m$ is
$\{m_1, \ldots, m_l \}$ then $m$ has one pointer for each
non-initial move $m_i$ in the equivalence class.


Let $s$ be a justified sequence of moves on the interaction game
$\intersem{T}$. Let $T'$ be a subtree of $T$. We define the
filtering operator $s\upharpoonright T$ to be the subsequence of
$s$ consisting of moves $\sim$-equivalent to some move in $M_T$. 
This operation make the moves ``lose'' some of their pointers:
a given move $m$ with equivalence class $\{m_1, \ldots, m_l \}$ may have up to $l$ pointers, but in $s\upharpoonright T$,
only pointers associated to $m_i$s belonging to $\mathcal{M}_{T'}$ are preserved.

We also define the filtering operator $s\upharpoonright type(T')$ as
the subsequence of $s$ consisting of moves from $type(T')$ where at
most one pointer is kept for each move in the sequence: the one
corresponding to the class citizen from $type(T')$.

By extension, we also define these operations on sets of justified
sequences.

\begin{definition}[Legal uncovered positions] We recall
that in the standard game semantics, the set of legal positions
$L_A$ of a game $A$ is the set of justified sequences of moves from
$M_A$ respecting visibility and alternation. We define the set of
\defname{legal uncovered position} $L_T$ of an interaction game $\intersem{T}$ as
follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item If $T$ is a leaf annotated by a type $A$ then $L_T =
    L_A$;
    \item If $T$ is a unary node with child node $T'$ then:
    $$L_T = \{ s \in JustSeq(T) \ | \ s \filter type(T) \in L_{type(T)} \zand  s \filter T' \in L_{T'} \} \ ;$$
    \item If $T$ is a binary node with children nodes $T_1$ and $T_2$ then:
    $$L_T = \{ s \in JustSeq(T) \ | \ s \filter type(T) \in L_{type(T)} \zand  s \filter T_1 \in L_{T_1}
    \zand  s \filter T_2 \in L_{T_2} \} \ .$$
    \end{itemize}
    where $JustSeq(T)$ denotes the set of justified interaction sequences on
    $\intersem{T}$.
\end{definition}

Revealed strategies can alternatively be represented as by means
of sets of uncovered positions:
\begin{definition}[Revealed strategies as set of uncovered positions]
The set of uncovered positions of a revealed strategy is defined inductively on the
structure of the annotated interaction type tree underlying the
interaction strategy:
\begin{itemize}[-]
\item Leaf labelled with type $A$ and annotated by the strategy $\sigma$: The set of positions of the revealed strategy is precisely the set of positions of the standard strategy $\sigma$.

\item Tensor product, pairing, promotion, currying:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\Sigma_1 : \intersem{T_1}) \otimes (\Sigma_2 : \intersem{T_2}) : \intersem{T} &=& \{ s \in L_T \ | \ s \filter type(T) \in
(\Sigma_1 \filter type(T_1)) \otimes (\Sigma_2 \filter type(T_2)) \\
&& \zand\ s \filter T_1 \in \Sigma_1 \zand\ s \filter T_2 \in \Sigma_2 \}
\\ \\
\langle \Sigma_1 : \intersem{T_1}, \Sigma_2 : \intersem{T_2} \rangle : \intersem{T} &=& \{ s \in L_T \ | \ s \filter type(T) \in
\langle \Sigma_1 \filter type(T_1), \Sigma_2 \filter type(T_2) \rangle \\
&& \zand\ s \filter T_1 \in \Sigma_1 \zand\ s \filter T_2 \in \Sigma_2 \}
\\ \\
(\Sigma' : \intersem{T'})^\dagger : \intersem{T} &=& \{ s \in L_T \ | \ s \filter type(T) \in
    (\Sigma' \filter type(T'))^\dagger\\
&& \zand\ s \filter T' \in \Sigma' \}
\\ \\
\Lambda(\Sigma' : \intersem{T'}) : \intersem{T} &=& \{ s \in L_T \ | \ s \filter type(T) \in
    \Lambda(\Sigma' \filter type(T'))\\
&& \zand\ s \filter T' \in \Sigma' \}\end{eqnarray*}

\item Uncovered composition $(\Sigma_1 : \intersem{T_1})\ ;^U\ (\Sigma_2
:\intersem{T_2})$ defined on the game $\intersem{T}$

    Suppose that $type(T_1) = A \multimap B_0 \times \ldots \times B_l$ and $type(T_2) = B_0 \times \ldots \times B_l \multimap C$ then $\Sigma_1 ;^U \Sigma_1$ is the
set of uncovered plays obtained by performing the usual composition
while ignoring and copying the internal moves from arenas in
$\intersem{T_1}$ or $\intersem{T_2}$ and preserving any internal
move produced by the composition in some component $B_k$ for $k \in
U$. Formally:
$$ \Sigma_1 \| \Sigma_2 = \{ u \in L_T  \ | \ u \upharpoonright T_1 \in \Sigma_1 \mbox{ and } u \upharpoonright T_2 \in \Sigma_2  \}$$
$$ \Sigma_1 ;^U \Sigma_2 = \{ cover(u,U) \ | \ u \in \Sigma_1 \| \Sigma_2 \}$$
where $cover(u,U)$ denotes the subsequence of $u$ obtained by
removing nodes that are in $B_j$ for some $j \in ( 0..l )
\setminus U$ (hence $\Sigma_1;^{\{0..l\}} \Sigma_2 = \Sigma_1 \|
\Sigma_2$);
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
We write $\mathcal{I}$ to denote the set of all revealed strategies.
\smallskip

\emph{Remark:} $\mathcal{I}$ is not a category since composition is
not associative and there is no identity interaction strategy.



\subsubsection{Modeling the $\lambda$-calculus in $\mathcal{I}$}

We would like to use revealed strategies from $\mathcal{I}$ to model terms of
the simply-typed lambda calculus.
Depending on the internal moves that we wish to hide, we obtain different possible interaction strategies for a given term.
The following definition fixes a unique strategy denotation which is computed from the $\eta$-normal form of the term.

\begin{definition}[Revealed denotation of a term]
\label{dfn:interactionstrategy_ofterms}
Let $\pi_i$ denote the $i^{th}$ projection copycat strategy $\pi_i : \sem{X_1 \times \ldots \times X_l} \rightarrow \sem{X_i}$.

The \emph{revealed game denotation} or \emph{revealed strategy} of
$M$ written $\intersem{\Gamma \vdash M : A}$ is defined by
structural induction on the \emph{$\eta$-long normal form of $M$} as
follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\intersem{\Gamma \vdash \lambda \overline{\xi} . M  : A} &=& \Lambda^{|\overline{\xi}|}(\intersem{\Gamma, \overline{\xi} \vdash M : o })  \\
\intersem{x_1 : X_1 \ldots x_l :X_l \vdash x_i : o} &=& \pi_i  \\
\intersem{\Gamma \vdash a :o } &=& \sem{\Gamma \vdash a : o}  \\
\intersem{y_1 : Y_1 \ldots y_i : A_0 \ldots y_l : Y_l \vdash y_i N_1 \ldots N_p :o} &=& \langle \pi_i, \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_1 : A_1}, \ldots, \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_p : A_p}  \rangle \fatsemi ^{\{1..p\}} ev^p \\
\intersem{\Gamma \vdash f N_1 \ldots N_p : o} &=& \langle \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_1 : A_1}, \ldots, \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_p : A_p} \rangle^\dagger\  \|\ \sem{f} \\
\intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_0 \ldots N_p : o} &=& \langle \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_0 : A_0}, \ldots, \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_p : A_p}  \rangle^\dagger\ \|\ ev^p
\end{eqnarray*}
where $a:o$, $f : A_0$ are $\Sigma$-constants, $p\geq 1$, $A_0 =
(A_1,\ldots,A_p,o)$ and $ev^p$ denotes the evaluation strategy with
$p$ parameters.

We write $\intersem{\Gamma \rightarrow A}_M$ to denote the
interaction arena of the revealed strategy $\intersem{\Gamma \vdash
M : A}$.
\end{definition}
Note that when computing an interaction strategy of the form
$\intersem{y_i N_1 \ldots N_p}$ for some variable $y_i$, the
internal moves of $N_1$, \ldots, $N_p$ are preserved however the
internal moves produced by the copy-cat projection strategy denoting
$y_i$ are omitted.

\begin{exmp}
Consider the term $\lambda x . (\lambda f . f x) (\lambda y . y)$.
Its computation tree is:
$$
\tree{\lambda x} {
    \pstree[levelsep=4ex]{\TR{@}}
    {       \pstree[levelsep=4ex]{\TR{\lambda f}}
                { \tree{f}{  \tree{\lambda}{ \TR{x}  } } }
            \pstree[levelsep=4ex]{\TR{\lambda y}}
                    {\TR{y}}
    } }
$$
and its revealed strategy is $\langle \sem{ x:X \vdash \lambda f . f
x : (o\rightarrow o) \rightarrow o} , \sem{ x:X \vdash \lambda y . y
: o \rightarrow o} \rangle \fatsemi^{\{0,1\}} ev_2$.
\end{exmp}


\subsubsection{From interaction semantics to standard semantics and vice-versa}

In the standard semantics, given two strategies $\sigma : A \rightarrow B$, $\tau : B \rightarrow C$ and
a sequence $s \in \sigma \fatsemi \tau$, it is possible to (uniquely) recover the internal moves. The uncovered sequence is written
${\bf u}(s, \sigma, \tau)$. The algorithm to obtain this unique uncovering is given in part II of \cite{hylandong_pcf}.

Given a term $M$, we can completely uncover the internal moves of a
sequence $s\in\sem{M}$ by performing the uncovering recursively at
every @-node of the computation tree. This operation is called
\emph{full-uncovering with respect to $M$}.

Conversely, the standard semantics can be recovered from the
interaction semantics by filtering the moves, keeping only those
played in the root arena:
\begin{eqnarray}
 \sem{\Gamma \vdash M : A} = \intersem{\Gamma \vdash M : A} \upharpoonright \sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T} \label{eqn:int_std_gamsem}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{The correspondence theorem for the simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus without interpreted constants}
In this section, we establish a
connection between the interaction semantics of a simply-typed term without constants ($\Sigma = \emptyset$)
and the traversals of its computation tree. We fix a term $\Gamma \vdash M : T$.

\subsubsection{Removing @-nodes from traversals}

When defining computation trees, it was necessary to introduce
application nodes (labelled @) in order to connect the operator and
the operand of an application. The presence of @-nodes has also
another advantage: it ensures that the lambda-nodes are all at even
level in the computation tree. Consequently a traversal respects
Alternation.

Application nodes are however redundant in the sense that they do
not play any role in the computation of the term. In other words,
the @-nodes occurring in traversals are superfluous. In fact it is
necessary to filter them out if we want to establish the
correspondence with the interaction game semantics.

\begin{definition}[Filtering @-nodes in traversals]
\label{dfn:appnode_filter}
Let $t$ be a traversal of $\tau(M)$.
We write $t-@$ for the sequence of nodes with pointers obtained by
\begin{itemize}
\item removing from $t$ all @-nodes and value-leaves of a @-node;
\item replacing any link pointing to an @-node by a link pointing to the immediate predecessor of @ in $t$.
\end{itemize}

Suppose $u = t-@$ is a sequence of nodes obtained by applying the
previously defined transformation on the traversal $t$, then $t$ can
be partially recovered from $u$ by reinserting the @-nodes as
follows. For each @-node @ in the computation tree with parent node
denoted by $p$, we perform the following operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item replace every occurrence of the pattern $p \cdot n$, where $n$ is a $\lambda$-nodes,
by $p \cdot @ \cdot n$;
\item replace any link in $u$ starting from a $\lambda$-node and pointing to $p$ by a link pointing to the inserted @-node;
\item if there is an occurrence in $u$ of a value-leaf $v_p$ pointing to $p$ then insert a value-leaf $v_@$
immediately before $v_p$ and make it point to the node immediately
following $p$ (which is also the $@$-node that we inserted in 1).
\end{enumerate}
We write $u+@$ for this second transformation.
\end{definition}
These transformations are well-defined because in a traversal, an @-node
always occurs in-between two nodes $n_1$ and $n_2$ such that  $n_1$ is the parent node of @
and $n_2$ is the first child node of @ in the computation tree:
$$      \pstree[levelsep=4ex]{\TR{n_1}\treelabel{0} }
        {
            \pstree[levelsep=3ex]{\TR{@}}
            {
                \tree{n_2}{\vdots}
                \TR[edge=\dedge]{}
                \TR[edge=\dedge]{}
            }
        }
$$
Remark: $t-@$ is not a proper justified sequence
since after removing a @-node, any $\lambda$-node justified by @ will become
justified by the parent of @ which is also a $\lambda$-node.

The following lemma follows directly from the definition:
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:minus_at_plus_at}
For any traversal $t$ we have $(t-@)+@ \sqsubseteq t$ and if $t$ does not end with an @-node then
$(t-@)+@ = t$.
\end{lemma}

Let $r$ denote the root of $\tau(M)$. We introduce the following notations:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\travset(M)^{-@} &=& \{ t - @ \ | \  t \in \travset(M) \} \\
\travset(M)^{\upharpoonright r} &=& \{ t  \upharpoonright r \ | \  t  \in \travset(M) \} \ .
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{lemma}
If $M$ is in $\beta$-normal form then $t = t \upharpoonright r = t - @$ for any $t \in \travset(M)$.
Consequently $\travset(M)^{-@} = \travset(M) =  \travset(M)^{\upharpoonright r }$\ .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The computation tree of a  $\beta$-normal term does not contain any @-node therefore all the nodes are hereditarily justified by the root.
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}[Filtering lemma]
\label{lem:varphi_filter}
For any traversal $t$ we have
$\varphi(t-@) \upharpoonright \sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T} = \varphi(t\upharpoonright r)$.
Consequently:
$$ \varphi(\travset^{-@}(M)) \upharpoonright \sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T} = \varphi(\travset^{\upharpoonright r}(M))\ .$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    From the definition of $\varphi$, the nodes of the computation tree that are mapped by $\varphi$
    to moves of the arena $\sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T}$ are exactly the nodes that are hereditarily justified by $r$.
    The result follows from the fact that @-nodes are not hereditarily justified by the root.
\end{proof}

The function $\varphi$ regarded as a function from the set of vertices $V_\lambda \union V_{var}$ of the computation tree to moves in arenas is not injective.
For instance the two occurrences of $x$ in the computation tree of the term $\lambda f x. f x x$ are mapped to the same question. However
the function $\varphi$ regarded as a function from sequences of nodes to sequences of moves is injective:
\begin{lemma}[$\varphi$ is injective]
\label{lem:varphiinjective}
$\varphi$ regarded as a function defined on the set of
sequences of nodes is injective in the sense that for any two traversals $t_1$ and $t_2$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] if $\varphi (t_1 - @ ) = \varphi (t_2 - @ )$ then $t_1-@ =t_2 -@$\ ;
\item[(ii)] if $\varphi (t_1 \upharpoonright r ) = \varphi (t_2 \upharpoonright r )$ then $t_1\upharpoonright r = t_2\upharpoonright r$\ .
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
For any node $n$ of a traversal $t$ we write $ptr(n)$ to denote the distance between $n$ and its justifier node in $t$. If $n$ has not link then we set $ptr(n)=0$. We also use the same notation for sequences of moves.

\begin{lemma}[Preleminary lemma]
\label{lem:varphiinjective:prelem}
\begin{equation}
\left(
  \begin{array}{ll}
    t \cdot n_1, t \cdot n_2 \in \travset \\
    \zand\ n_1 \neq n_2
  \end{array}
\right)
 \mbox{ implies } n_1,n_2 \in N^{\upharpoonright r}_{\lambda} \zand ( \varphi(n_1) \neq \varphi(n_2) \zor ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2) ) \ . \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $t \cdot n_1, t \cdot n_2 \in \travset$.
First we remark that the traversal rules have a weak form of determinism which ensures that $n_1$ and $n_2$ belong to the same category of node i.e.\ they must be both in $N_{var}$, $N_@$ or $N_\lambda$.

Suppose that $n_1, n_2 \in N_@$ then $t \cdot n_1$ and $t \cdot n_2$ were formed using the (App) rule. Since this rule is deterministic we must have $n_1=n_2$ which violates the second hypothesis.


Suppose that $n_1,n_2\in N_{var}$. The traversals $t \cdot n_1$ and $t \cdot n_2$ must have been formed using either rule (Lam) or (App). But these two rules are deterministic and their domains of definition are disjoint. Hence again the second hypothesis is violated.

Suppose that $n_1,n_2\in N_\lambda$ then
the traversals $t \cdot n_1$ and $t \cdot n_2$ must have been formed using either rule (Root), (App), (Var) or (InputVar). Since all these rules have disjoint domains of definition, the same rule must have been use to form $t \cdot n_1$ and $t \cdot n_2$. Supposed that one of the rules (Root), (App) and (Var) has been used then since they are all deterministic we have $n_1=n_2$ which violates the second hypothesis. Consequently, the rule (InputVar) must have been used and therefore $n_1,n_2 \in N_\lambda^{\upharpoonright r}$. By definition of (InputVar), in order to have $n_1\neq n_2$ and $\varphi(n_1) = \varphi(n_2)$, the parent node of the last node in $t$ must occurs at more than one position in $\oview{t}$ and $n_1,n_2$ correspond to the child node of two different occurrences of that parent node in $\oview{t}$. But then the links associated to $n_1$ and $n_2$ will point to their respective occurrence of that parent node in $\oview{t}$ hence $ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2)$.
\end{proof}

\noindent {\it (continuation of the proof of Lemma \ref{lem:varphiinjective})}

(i) The result is trivial is either $t_1$ or $t_2$ is empty.
Suppose that $t_1-@\neq t_2-@$ then necessarily $t_1 \neq t_2$, thus there are some sequences $t'$, $u_1$, $u_2$ and some nodes $n_1,n_2$ such that
 $t_1 = t' \cdot n_1 \cdot u_1$, $t_2 = t' \cdot n_2 \cdot u_2$ with either $n_1\neq n_2$ or $ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2)$.

If $n_1 = n_2$ then $ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2)$ therefore $n_1,n_2 \not\in N_@$ (otherwise $ptr(n_1) = 0 = ptr(n_2)$). Since $ptr(\varphi(n_1)) = ptr(n_1)$ and  $ptr(\varphi(n_2)) = ptr(n_2)$ we must have $\varphi(t' \cdot n_1) \neq \varphi(t' \cdot n_2)$. Since $n_1,n_2 \not\in N_@$ we also have $\varphi((t' \cdot n_1)-@) \neq \varphi((t' \cdot n_2)-@)$. Hence $\varphi(t_1-@) \neq \varphi(t_2-@)$.

If $n_1 \neq n_2$ then by Lemma \ref{lem:varphiinjective:prelem} we have $n_1,n_2 \not\in N_@$ and $\varphi(n_1) \neq \varphi(n_2)$ or $ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2)$ which again implies $\varphi(t_1-@) \neq \varphi(t_2-@)$.


(ii) Suppose that $t \upharpoonright r \neq t' \upharpoonright r$ then necessarily $t \neq t'$ which in turn implies that for some sequences $t_1'$, $t_2'$, $u_1$, $u_2$ and some nodes $n_1 \neq n_2$
we have $t_1 = t' \cdot n_1 \cdot u_1$, $t_2 = t' \cdot n_2 \cdot u_2$ and either $n_1\neq n_2$ or $ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2)$.

If $n_1 = n_2$ then $ptr(n_1) \neq ptr(n_2)$. An   analysis of the traversal rules shows that the rule (InputVar) is the only rule which can visit the same node with two different pointers. Hence $n_1,n_2 \in N_\lambda^{\upharpoonright r}$.
Therefore $\varphi( (t'\cdot n_1) \upharpoonright r ) = \varphi( (t'\upharpoonright r) \cdot n_1 )  \neq \varphi( (t'\upharpoonright r) \cdot n_2 )$. Hence    $\varphi( t_1\upharpoonright r ) \neq \varphi( t_2\upharpoonright r )$.

If $n_1 \neq n_2$ then we can use Lemma \ref{lem:varphiinjective:prelem}
to obtain $\varphi( t_1\upharpoonright r ) \neq \varphi( t_2\upharpoonright r )$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \
\label{cor:varphi_bij}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] $\varphi$ defines a bijection from $\travset(M)^{-@}$
to $\varphi(\travset(M)^{-@})$\ ;

\subsubsection{The correspondence theorem}
We now state and prove the correspondence theorem for
the simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus without interpreted constants
($\Sigma = \emptyset$). The result extends immediately to the
simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus with \emph{uninterpreted} constants
by considering constants as being free variables. We write $\sem{\Gamma \vdash
M : A}$ for the strategy (in the standard cartesian closed category of games and innocent strategies
(\cite{abramsky94full, hylandong_pcf}) denoting the simply-typed term $\Gamma
\vdash M : A$.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:rel_gamesem_trav} Let $\Gamma \vdash M : T$ be a
simply-typed $\lambda$-term and $r$ be the root of $\tau(M)$. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)]  $\varphi_M(\travset(M)^{-@}) = \intersem{M}$ \ ;
\item[(ii)] $\varphi_M(\travset(M)^{\upharpoonright r}) = \sem{M}$ \ .
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}


\begin{remark} The proof that follows is quite technical. Let us give a brief overview of the argument.
    We start by reducing the problem to the case of closed terms only. Then the proof proceeds by induction on the structure of the computation tree.
The base case is straightforward. For the application case, the
computation tree $\tau(M)$ has the following form:
    $$ \tree[levelsep=4ex]{\lambda \overline{\xi}}
        { \tree[levelsep=4ex]{@}
            {   \TR{\tau(N_0)} \TR{\ldots} \TR{\tau(N_p)}}}
    $$

    A traversal of $\tau(M)$ proceeds as follows: it starts at the root $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ of the tree $\tau(M)$ (rule
    (Root)), it then passes the node @ (rule (Lam)).
    After this initialization part, it proceeds by traversing the term $N_0$ (rule (App)).
    At some point, while traversing $N_0$, some variable $y_i$ bound by the root of $N_0$ is visited. The traversal
    of $N_0$ is interrupted and jumps (rule (Var)) to the root of $\tau(N_i)$. The process then goes on with $\tau(N_i)$.
    When traversing $N_i$, if the traversal encounters a variable bound by the root of $\tau(N_i)$ then the traversal of $N_i$
    is interrupted and
    the traversal of $N_0$ resumes.  This schema is repeated until the traversal of $\tau(N_0)$ is completed\footnote{Since we are considering
    simply-typed terms, the traversal does indeed terminate. However this will not be true anymore in the \pcf\ case.}.

    The traversal of $M$ is therefore made of an initialization part followed by an interleaving of a traversal of $N_0$ and
    several traversals of $N_i$ for $i=1..p$. This schema is reminiscent of the way the evaluation copycat map $ev$ works in game semantics.

    The key idea is that every time the traversal pauses the traversal of a subterm and switches to another one,
    the jump is permitted by one of the four copycat rules (Var), (CCAnswer-@), (CCAnswer-$\lambda$) or (CCAnswer-var).
    We show by (a second) induction that these copycat rules define precisely what the copycat strategy $ev$ performs on sets of plays.

%    In the game semantics, the evaluation map (a copy-cat strategy) copies this opening move to an initial move $m_0$ in the game
%    $B_0$ and the game continues in $B_0$. We reflect this in the traversal : we make $t$ follow
%    the ``script'' given by the traversal $t^0_{m_0}$.
%    The rule (App) allow us to initiate this simulation  by visiting the  first move in $t^0_{m_0}$: the root of $\tau(N_0)$.
%
%    This simulation continues until it reaches a node $\alpha_0$ which is hereditarily justified by the root
%    $\tau(N_0)$: $\alpha_0$ is present in the reduction of traversal of $t^0_{m_0}$ therefore $\varphi_{N_0}(\alpha_0)$ is an un-hidden move played in $A_0$.
%
%    In the game semantics this corresponds to a move played in a component $A_k$ for some $k\in 1..p$ of
%    of the game $B_0$ in which case the evaluation map copies the move to an initial move $m_1$ in the corresponding component $B_k$.
%
%    To reflect this the traversal now opens up a new thread and simulates the traversal $t^k_{m_1}$.  Again, this simulation stops when we reach a node
%    $\alpha_1$ in $t^k_{m_1}$ which is hereditarily justified by the root of $\tau(N_k)$: $\alpha_1$ must be present in the reduction of traversal
%    of $t^k_{m_1}$ therefore $\varphi_{N_k}(\alpha_1)$ is an un-hidden move played in $A_k$.
%    In the game semantics, this move $\alpha$ is copied back to the component $B_k$ of the game $B_0$.
%
%    The traversal now resumes the simulation of $t^0_{m_0}$. And the process goes continuously.
\end{remark}
\smallskip

Let us fix some notation: we write $s\upharpoonright A,B$ for the
sequence obtained from $s$ by keeping only the moves that are in $A$ or $B$ and by removing any link pointing to a move that
has been removed.
If $m$ is an initial move, we write $s \upharpoonright m$ to
denote the thread of $s$ initiated by $m$, i.e. the sequence obtained from $s$ by keeping all the moves
hereditarily justified by $m$.
We also write $s \upharpoonright A,B,m$ where $m$ is an initial move
for the sequence obtained from $s \upharpoonright A,B$ by keeping
all moves hereditarily justified by $m$.



\begin{proof}
(i) Suppose $\Gamma = \xi_1:X_1,\ldots \xi_n:X_n$. Then we have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\intersem{\Gamma \vdash M:T} &=& \Lambda^n( \intersem{\emptyset \vdash \lambda \xi_1\ldots \xi_n . M: (X_1,\ldots,X_n,T) } ) \\
        &\simeq& \intersem{\emptyset \vdash \lambda \xi_1\ldots \xi_n . M: (X_1,\ldots,X_n,T) }\ .
\end{eqnarray*}
Similarly the computation tree $\tau(M)$ is isomorphic to
$\tau(\lambda \xi_1\ldots \xi_n . M)$ (up to a renaming of the root
of the computation tree) therefore $\travset(M)$ is isomorphic to
$\travset(\lambda \xi_1\ldots \xi_n . M)$. Hence we can make the
assumption that $M$ is a closed term. If we prove that the property
is true for all closed terms of a given height then it will be
automatically true for any open term of the same height.


Let us assume that $M$ is already in $\eta$-long normal form. We
proceed by induction on the height of the tree $\tau(M)$ and by
case analysis on the structure of the computation tree:
\begin{itemize}
  \item (abstraction) $M \equiv \lambda \overline{\xi} .
  x$.  Since $M$ is in $\eta$-long normal form, $x$ must be of ground type and since $M$ is
      closed we have $x = \xi_i \in \overline{\xi}$ for some $i$.
      Hence $\tau(M)$ has the following shape:
        $$ \tree[levelsep=6ex]{ \lambda \overline{\xi}^{[0]} }{\TR{\xi_i^{[1]}}}$$
        The arena is of the following form (only question moves are represented):
        $$ \tree{ q_0 }
        {   \tree[linestyle=dotted]{q^1}{\TR{} \TR{} }
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{q^2}{\TR{} \TR{} }
            \TR{\ldots}
            \tree[linestyle=dotted]{q^n}{\TR{} \TR{} }
        }$$

        Let $\pi_i$ denote the $i$th projection of the interaction game
        semantics. We have:
        \begin{align*}
        \intersem{M} &= \intersem{\emptyset \vdash \lambda \overline{\xi} . \xi_i} \\
                     &= \Lambda^n(\intersem{\overline{\xi} \vdash  \xi_i}) \\
                     &= \Lambda^n(\pi_i) \\
                     &\cong \pi_i \\
                     &= \prefset(\{ q_0 \cdot q^i \cdot v_{q^i} \cdot v_{q_0} \ | \ v\in \mathcal{D}
                     \})\ .
        \end{align*}

        Since $M$ is in $\beta$-normal we have $\travset(M)^{-@} = \travset(M)$.
        It is easy to see that the set of traversals of $M$ is the set of prefix of
        the traversal $\lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot \xi_i \cdot v_{\xi_i} \cdot v_{\lambda \overline{\xi}}$:
        $$ \travset^{-@}(M) = \travset(M) = \prefset( \lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot \xi_i \cdot v_{\xi_i} \cdot v_{\lambda \overline{\xi}}) \ .
        $$

        The pointers of the traversal $\lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot \xi_i \cdot v_{\xi_i} \cdot
        v_{\lambda \overline{\xi}}$ are the same as the play $q_0 \cdot q^i \cdot v_{q^i} \cdot
        v_{q_0}$, therefore since $\varphi_M(\lambda \overline{\xi}) = q_0$ and $\varphi_M(\xi_i) =
        q^i$ we have:
        $$ \varphi_M(\travset^{-@}(M)) = \intersem{M}\ .$$


    \item (application followed by an abstraction) $M = \lambda \overline{\xi} . N_0 N_1 \ldots N_p$. Let $\Gamma$ be the context
    consisting of the variables $\overline{\xi} : \overline{X}$.
    We have the following typing judgments: $\emptyset \vdash M
    : (X_1,\ldots,X_n,o)$, $\Gamma \vdash N_0 N_1 \ldots N_p :
    o$, $\Gamma \vdash N_i : B_i$ for $i\in 0..p$ with $B_0 =
    (B_1,\ldots,B_p,o)$ and $p\geq 1$.

    There are two subcases, either $N_0 \equiv \xi_i$ where
    $\alpha$ is a variable in $\overline{\xi}$ in which case the
    tree has the following form:
    $$ \tree[levelsep=6ex]{\lambda \overline{\xi}^{[0]}}
        { \tree[levelsep=6ex]{\xi_i^{[1]}}
            {   \TR{\tau(N_1)} \TR{\ldots} \TR{\tau(N_p)}}}
    $$
    or $N_0$ is not a variable and the tree $\tau(M)$ has the following form:
    $$ \tree[levelsep=6ex]{\lambda \overline{\xi}^{[0]}}
        { \tree[levelsep=6ex]{@^{[1]}}
            {
            \tree[levelsep=6ex]{\lambda y_1 \ldots y_p}{\ldots}
            \TR{\tau(N_1)} \TR{\ldots} \TR{\tau(N_p)}}}
    $$

    We only consider the second case since the first one can be treated
    similarly. Moreover we make the assumption that $p=1$. It is
    straightforward to generalize to any $p\geq1$.
    We write $\lambda \overline{z}$ to denote the root of the tree $\tau(N_1)$.


    We have:
    \begin{align*}
    \intersem{M}
        &=  \Lambda^n( \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_0 N_1 : o} )
            & \mbox{(revealed semantics for abstraction)}\\
        &\cong  \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_0 N_1 : o}
            & \mbox{(up to moves retagging)}\\
        &=  \langle \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_0}, \intersem{\Gamma \vdash N_1} \rangle^\dagger\ \| \ ev
            & \mbox{(revealed semantics for application)}\\
        &=  \langle \varphi_{N_0} (\travset^{-@}(N_0)), \varphi_{N_1}(\travset^{-@}(N_1) \rangle^\dagger\ \| \ ev
            & \mbox{(induction hypothesis)}\\
        &=  \underbrace{\langle \varphi_{M} (\travset^{-@}(N_0)), \varphi_{M}(\travset^{-@}(N_1)) \rangle}_{\sigma} \,^\dagger\ \| \ ev
            & \mbox{($\varphi_M = \psi_{\sem{\Gamma\rightarrow T}}^{r,q_0} \union \varphi_{N_0} \union \varphi_{N_1}$)} %\\
%        &=  \underbrace{\langle \varphi_{M} (\travset^{-@}(N_0)), \varphi_{M}(\travset^{-@}(N_1)) \rangle}_{\sigma}^\dagger\ \| \  ev
%            & \mbox{($\fatsemi^{0..1}$ and $\parallel$ are the same operator)}
    \end{align*}


    The revealed strategy $\sigma$ is defined on the interaction
    arena $\intersem{T_1}$ whose root is $!A \multimap B$ where
    \begin{eqnarray*}
        A &=& \Gamma = X_1 \times \ldots \times X_n\\
        B &=& \underbrace{(B_1' \rightarrow o')}_{B_0} \times B_1
    \end{eqnarray*}
    The strategy $ev$ is defined on the interaction arena
    $\intersem{T_2}$ with a single arena-node $!B \multimap C$
    with $C = o$. Thus, plays of $ev$ do not contain uncovered
    moves.


    Let $\intersem{T}$ denote the interaction arena of the
    revealed strategy $\intersem{M}$. We have $u \in
    \intersem{M} \cong \sigma^{\dag}
    \parallel ev$ if and only if
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      &&      \left\{
            \begin{array}{ll}
                u \in L_T\\
                u \upharpoonright T_1  \in \sigma^\dagger \\
                u \upharpoonright !B,C  \in  ev
            \end{array}
            \right. \\
    & \mbox{or equivalently} & \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        u \in int(\intersem{T}) \\
        \hbox{for any initial $m$ in $u \upharpoonright !A,!B$ there is $j \in 0..p$ such that } \\
        \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
            u \upharpoonright \intersem{T_1} \inter B_j, m \in \varphi_{M} (\travset^{-@}(N_j)) \label{eq:def_z} \\
            u \upharpoonright \intersem{T_1} \inter B_k,m = \epsilon \quad \mbox{ for every } k\neq j \label{eq:b}
        \end{array}
        \right. \\
        u \upharpoonright !B,C  \in  ev
    \end{array}
    \right.
    \end{eqnarray*}


    We first prove that $\intersem{M} \subseteq \varphi_{M}( \travset^{-@}(M)
    )$.


    Suppose $u \in \intersem{M}$. We give a constructive proof
    that there exists a sequence of nodes $t$ in $N$ such that
    $\varphi_M(t-@) = u$ by induction on the length of $u$. Let
    $q_o$ and $q_1$ be the initial question of the arena
    $\sem{M}$ and $\sem{N_0}$ respectively.

    {\emph Base cases}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $u=\epsilon$ then $\varphi(\epsilon) = u$ where the traversal $\epsilon$ is formed with the rule ($\epsilon$).
    \item If $|u|=1$ then $u=q_0$ is the initial move in $C$ and $\varphi(\lambda \overline{\xi}) = u$. The traversal
    $\lambda \overline{\xi}$ is formed with the rule (Root).
    \end{itemize}

    {\emph Step cases}: Suppose that $u = \overbrace{\ldots
    \cdot m^1}^{u'} \cdot\ m \in \intersem{M}$ where $u' =
    \varphi_M(t'-@)$ for some traversal $t'$ of $\tau(M)$.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Suppose $m \in C$. C-moves are played by the strategy $ev$ whose plays do not contain any internal move.
    Hence $m$ is either $q_0$ or $v_{q_0}$ for some
    $v\in\mathcal{D}$. Since $q_0$ can occur only once in
    $u$ and $|u|>1$ we must have $m = v_{q_0}$ for some
    $v\in \mathcal{D}$.  Since $m$ is an answer P-move to
    the initial question, it must be the move played by the
    copy-cat evaluation strategy corresponding to the copy
    of the move $m^1$ in $o'$. Hence $m^1=v_{q_1}$. By the
    induction hypothesis, $n'$ -- the last move in $t'$ --
    is $\varphi(m^1) = v_{\lambda y_1}$.

    By property \ref{proper:phi_pview}(iv), $?(u') =
    \varphi(?(t'-@))$ and since $q_0$ is the pending
    question in $u'$, the first node of $t'$ is also the
    pending node in $t'$. This permits us to use the rule
    (CCAnswer-$\lambda$) to produce the traversal $t = t'
    \cdot v_{\lambda \overline{\xi}}$ where $v_{\lambda
    \overline{\xi}}$ points to the first node in $t'$.
    Clearly we have $\varphi(t-@) = u$.



    \item Suppose that $m,m^1 \in A \union B_0$.
    The strategy $ev$ is responsible for switching thread in $B_0$ therefore, in the interaction semantics,
    there must be a copycat move in-between two moves belonging to two different threads.
    Since $m$ and $m^1$ are consecutive moves in the sequence $u$, they must belong to the same thread i.e. there are
    hereditarily justified  by the same initial $m_0$ in $B_0$.


    We then have $(u \upharpoonright !A, !B)\upharpoonright m_0 = \varphi_{N_0}(t_0-@)$ for some traversal $t_0$ of $N_0$.
    Consequently  $\varphi_{N_0}(n^1) = m^1$ and $\varphi_{N_0}(n) = m$
    where $n^1 \cdot n$ are the last two moves in $t_0-@$.

    $n$ points to some node in $t_0$ that also occurs in $t'$. Let us call $n^2$ this node.
    Since $(u \upharpoonright !A, !B)\upharpoonright m_0 = \varphi_{N_0}(t_0-@)$,
    $n_2$ must have the same position in $t'$ as the node justifying $m$ in $u'$.
    Hence we just need to take $t = t' \cdot n$ where $n$ points to $n^2$ in $t'$.

    The sequence $t$ is indeed a valid traversal of $\tau(M)$
    because the rule used by the traversal $t_0$
    of $\tau(N_0)$ to visit the node $n$ after $n^1$ can also be used by the traversal $t'$ of $\tau(M)$
    to visit $n$ after $n^1$.
    This can be checked formally by inspecting all the traversal rules. The key reason is that
    all the nodes in $t_0-@$ are present in $t'$ with the same pointers but with some nodes interleaved in between.
    However these interleaved nodes are inserted in a way that still permits to use the traversal rule.

    \item Suppose that $m,m^1 \in A \union B_1$.
    The proof is similar to the previous case.

    \item Suppose that $m \in A \union B_0$ and $m^1 \in A \union B_1$.

    $t$ is obtained from $t-@$ using the transformation $+@$. We apply the same transformation to $u$ in order
    to make $O$-questions and $P$-questions in $u$ match with $\lambda$-nodes and variable nodes in $t'$ respectively.
    We write this sequence $u+@$.
    The $+@$ operation inserts nodes in the sequence but not at the end,
    therefore $m^1$, the last move in $u'$, is also the last move in $u'+@$.
    Let us note $n^1$ for the last move in $t'$.

        \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $n^1$ is the application node @ then it must be the parent of the node $\lambda y_1$ since it
        is the only non-internal @-node present in $t'$.
        Therefore $t'=\lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot @$ and $u= q_0 \cdot m$.
        But $m$ is the copy of $q_0$ replicated by $ev$ in $o'$ therefore $m=q_1$.
        Applying the (App) rule on $t'$ produces the traversal $\lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot @ \cdot \lambda y_1$
        with $\varphi((\lambda \overline{\xi} \cdot @ \cdot \lambda y_1)-@ ) = q_0 \cdot q_1 = u$.

        \item If $n^1$ is a variable node then $m^1$ is a P-move and $m$ is an O-move
            and therefore $m$ is the copy of $m^1$ duplicated in $B_1$ by the evaluation strategy.
            Consequently, $m^1$ points to some $m^2$ and $m$ points to the node preceding $m^2$ denoted by $m^3$.
            The diagram below shows an example of such sequence:
                $$
                \begin{array}{cccccccc}
                & (B_1' &\rightarrow & o') & \times & B_1 & \rightarrow & o' \\
                O & &&&&&& \rnode{q0}{q_0 (\lambda \overline{\xi})} \\
                P & &&&&& \\
                O & && \rnode{q1}{q_1 (\lambda \overline{y})} \\
                P & \rnode{m3}{m^3 (y_1)} \\
                O & &&&& \rnode{m2}{m^2 (\lambda \overline{z})} \\
                P & &&&& \rnode{m1}{m^1 (z_i)} \\
                O & \rnode{m}{m} \\
                \end{array}
                \ncline[nodesep=3pt]{->}{q1}{q0} \mput*{@}
                \nccurve[nodesep=3pt,ncurv=2,angleA=180,angleB=180]{->}{m1}{m2}
                \ncarc[nodesep=3pt,ncurv=1,angleA=90,angleB=180]{->}{m3}{q1}
                \ncarc[nodesep=3pt,ncurv=1,angleA=90,angleB=180]{->}{m}{m3}
                \ncline[nodesep=3pt]{->}{m2}{q0}
                $$

        $t'$  and $u+@$ have the following forms:
        \begin{eqnarray*}
                t'&=& \Pstr{ \ldots \cdot n^3 \cdot (n2){n^2} \cdot \ldots \cdot (n1-n2,30){n^1} } \\ \\
                u+@ &=& \Pstr{ \ldots \cdot (m3){m^3} \cdot (m2){m^2} \cdot \ldots \cdot (m1-m2,30){m^1} \cdot (m-m3,30){m} }
        \end{eqnarray*}

        Since $n^1$ is a variable node, $n^2$ must be a $\lambda$-node.
        $n^3$ could be either a variable node or an @-node. In fact $n^3$ is necessarily a variable node. Indeed,
        $n^3$ is mapped to $m^3$ by $\varphi_{N_0}$ and $m^3$ belongs to $\sem{B_i'}$ (i.e. it is not
        an internal move of $\intersem{B_i'}$). The function $\varphi_{N_0}$ is defined in such a way that
        only nodes which are hereditarily justified by the root of $\tau(N_0)$ are mapped to nodes in $\sem{B_1'}$.
        Hence $n^3$ is hereditarily justified by the root and consequently it cannot be an @-node.

        Hence $n^1$ is a variable node, $n^2$ is a $\lambda$-node and $n^3$ is a variable node. We
        can therefore apply the (Var) rule to $t'$ and we obtain a traversal of the following form:

        \begin{eqnarray*}
            t&=& \Pstr{ \ldots \cdot (n3){n^3} \cdot (n2){n^2} \cdot \ldots \cdot (n1-n2,30){n^1} \cdot (n-n3,30){n} }
        \end{eqnarray*}

        We have $\varphi(t'-@) = u'$ by the induction hypothesis and $\varphi(n) = m$ by definition of $\varphi$.
        Therefore since $m$ and $n$ point to the same position we have $\varphi(t-@) = u$.

        \item If $n^1$ is the value-leaf of a variable node then we proceed the same way as in the previous case:
        $n^1$ is a value-leaf of the variable node $n^2$ and we can use the
        (CCAnswer-$\lambda$) rule to extend the traversal $t'$.

        \item Suppose that $n^1$ is a lambda node, in which case $m^1$ is an O-move, then
        necessarily, $m^1$ is a move copied by the evaluation strategy
         from $B_1'$ to $B_1$. The move following $m^1$ should also be played in $B_1$ before being copied
         back to $B_1'$ by the evaluation strategy. But since $m \in B_0$, this case does not happen.


        \item If $n^1$ is a value-leaf of a lambda node then $n^2$ is a lambda node and $n^3$ is a variable node.
        We can therefore use the rule (CCAnswer-var) or (CCAnswer-@) to extend the traversal $t'$.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item Suppose $m \in A \union B_1$ and $m^1 \in A \union B_0$ then
    the proof is similar to the previous case.
    \end{enumerate}


  For the converse, $\varphi_{M}( \travset^{-@}(M) ) \subseteq \intersem{M}$, it is an easy induction
  on the traversal rules. We omit the details here.
\end{itemize}

(ii) is an immediate consequence of (i):
\begin{align*}
\sem{M} &= \intersem{M} \upharpoonright \sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T} & \mbox{(eq. \ref{eqn:int_std_gamsem})} \\
        &= \varphi_M(\travset^{-@}(M)) \upharpoonright \sem{\Gamma \rightarrow T} & \mbox{(by (i))}\\
        &= \varphi_M(\travset^{\upharpoonright r}(M)) & \mbox{(lemma \ref{lem:varphi_filter})}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}


Putting corollary \ref{cor:varphi_bij} and proposition
\ref{prop:rel_gamesem_trav} together we obtain the following theorem
which establishes a correspondence between the game-denotation of a
term and the set of traversals of its computation tree:

\begin{theorem}[The Correspondence Theorem]
\label{thm:correspondence}
 For any simply-typed term $\Gamma \vdash M$,
$\varphi_M$ defines a bijection from $\travset(M)^{\upharpoonright
r}$ to $\sem{M}$ and a bijection from $\travset(M)^{-@}$ to
$\intersem{M}$:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \varphi_M  &:& \travset(\Gamma \vdash M)^{\upharpoonright r} \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \sem{\Gamma \vdash M} \\
 \varphi_M  &:& \travset(\Gamma \vdash M)^{-@} \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \intersem{\Gamma \vdash M}
\end{eqnarray*}

Moreover when $M$ is in $\beta$-normal form, for any traversal $t$, if $\varphi_M(t)$ is a \emph{maximal} play then $t$ is a \emph{maximal} traversal.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The first part is an immediate consequence of corollary
\ref{cor:varphi_bij} and proposition
\ref{prop:rel_gamesem_trav}.

Finally, if $M$ is in $\beta$-normal form then
$\travset(M)^{\upharpoonright r} = \travset(M)$
therefore $\varphi$ is defined on $\travset(M)$. Let $t$ be a traversal such that $\varphi(t)$ is a maximal play. Let $t'$ be a traversal such that $t \sqsubseteq t'$. By monotonicity of $\varphi$ this implies $\varphi(t) \sqsubseteq \varphi(t')$ and since $\varphi(t)$ is maximal we have $\varphi(t) = \varphi(t')$. $\varphi$ being injective we conclude $t'=t$.
\end{proof}
