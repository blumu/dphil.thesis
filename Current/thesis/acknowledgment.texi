I am profoundly grateful to Luke Ong for his patience, availability and encouragement throughout my DPhil. He is possibly the best supervisor a student could dream of. I also thank him for allocating me a 3-year studentship which allowed me to pursue my studies without financial concerns.

I express my gratitude to Colin Stirling, Monika Lekuse, Margaret Davis and Julian Bradfield from the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh who set up and offered me a 6-month research assistant position, undertaken during my last year, which allowed me to pursue my research further.

My thanks also go to the members of the Oxford Computing Laboratory with whom I have interacted during the course of my studies, in particular to Andrzej Muraswki, Samson Abramski, Matthew Hague, Damien Sereni, Jolie de Miranda, Sam Sanjabi, Mathieu Verbaere, Nikos Tzevelekos, and Christopher Broadbent. I also acknowledge Ugo dal Lago for insightful discussions we had during his visit to Oxford in March 2008.

In my last year I had a lot of fun playing football with people from the laboratory; I thank all the regular players, especially Ben Worrell and Jo\"el Ouaknine.

I am thankful to my examiners Samson Abramski and Guy McCusker for their careful reading of the thesis and insightful comments which contributed to improving its quality.

My friends also need to be acknowledged for making my stay in the UK so enjoyable: Ludovic, Maki, Sascha, Ross, Julien, Alex, Doroth\'ee and Yunjeong. Special thanks to Sascha Kuzin who helped me eliminate typos from the technical prose that follows.

Finally I am deeply grateful to my parents, brothers and close family who have supported me throughout the years, especially my adorable partner Lily (\begin{CJK*}{GB}{gbsn}\CJKtilde ¡÷«≥∫Æ \end{CJK*}).
