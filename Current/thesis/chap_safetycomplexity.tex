The idea of the proof is to encode the Henkin quantifier elimination of Type Theory into the simply-typed lambda calculus. The encoding relies on the fact that the function $\sf sg$ (conditional) can be encoded in the lambda-calculus. Hence the argument does not carry on   in the Safe Lambda Calculus since the conditional operator is not definable (\cite{blumong:safelambdacalculus}).

Mairson gave a simpler proof of Statman's theorem in \cite{mairson1992spt} which also proceeds by encoding the Henkin quantifier elimination procedure into the lambda-calculus. However this proof is much easier to understand as it makes use of list iteration to perform quantifier elimination.
