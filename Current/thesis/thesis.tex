\begin{abstract}
We consider a syntactic restriction for higher-order grammars called \emph{safety}  that  constrains occurrences of variables in the production rules according to their type-theoretic order. We transpose and generalize this restriction to the setting of the simply-typed lambda-calculus, giving us what we call the \emph{safe lambda calculus}. We study this language under different angles. First we give an account of its game semantic model. For that purpose, we introduce a new concrete presentation of game semantics based on the theory of \emph{traversals}: We show that the \emph{revealed game denotation} of a term can be computed by traversing some souped-up version of the abstract syntax tree of the term using adequately defined traversal rules. This result was presented at the Galop workshop at ETAPS 2008. This allows us to give a game-semantic analysis of safety via syntactic reasoning: We show that  safe lambda-terms are denoted by what we call \emph{P-incrementally justified strategies}. This result was presented at TLCA 2007.

We study the expressivity of the calculus and show a result in the
same vein as Schwichtenberg's 1976 characterization of the
simply-typed lambda calculus, we show that the numeric functions
representable in the safe lambda calculus are exactly the
multivariate polynomials; thus conditional is not definable. We
also give a characterization of representable word functions.
We then study the complexity of deciding beta-eta equality of two safe simply-typed terms and show that this problem is PSPACE-hard.

Finally we consider extension of the safety restriction to functional languages with recursion and references such as Idealized Algol.

\part{Contribution}


In the second chapter we present the \emph{safe $\lambda$-calculus}.
Originally, \emph{safety} has been introduced as a syntactical
restriction on higher-order grammars in order to show a decidability
result about MSO theory of infinite trees \citep{KNU02}. In
\cite{safety-mirlong2004}, Aehlig, de Miranda and Ong  proposed an
adaptation of the safety restriction to the $\lambda$-calculus. This
restriction gives rise to the safe $\lambda$-calculus. We first
present this calculus and then give a more general definition which
does not make any assumption on the types of the terms.

In the third chapter, following ideas described in
\cite{OngLics2006}, we introduce the notions of computation tree of
a simply-typed term and traversal over a computation tree. We prove
a theorem showing a correspondence between traversals of the
computation tree and the game semantics of a term. Based on that
correspondence, we give a characterisation of the game semantics of
safe terms by a property called ``P-incremental-justification''. In
P-incrementally-justified strategies, P-pointers are superfluous (i.e.
they can be recovered uniquely from the underlying sequence of
moves and from O-moves' pointers). This simplification of the game semantics suggests some potential applications in algorithmic game semantics. We finish the
chapter by extending the result to safe \pcf\ and by giving the key
elements for an extension to full Safe Idealized Algol.
