\section{The Theorem: motivation and explanation}

We now present our main result.

\begin{theorem} If $G$ is a higher-order grammar at level $2$ that is
not assumed to be safe, there exists a non-deterministic $2$PDA
that accepts the same language. Moreover, the conversion is effective.
\end{theorem}

Our proof is split into two transformations. Given a level-$2$ grammar
$G$, we show:
\begin{enumerate} \item The (compacting) pointer machine for $G$ is simulated by a
$2$PDAL, where $2$PDAL is a machine that has yet to be
introduced. (Section 5)
\item We then show that a $2$PDAL for $G$ can be simulated by a
nondeterministic $2$PDA. (Section 6)
\end{enumerate}

Combining our result with that of \cite{DG86}, we have:

\begin{corollary}
Every string language that is generated by an unsafe $2$-grammar can
also be generated by some safe (non-deterministic) $2$-grammar.
\end{corollary}

Thus safety is not really a restriction at level $2$ for string languages.
