% question 9
\item[How much teaching are you doing?] \

\answ{I tutored two groups of students for the classes of Introduction to Specification (Hilary 2006). I also did the marking for one group.}

% question 10
\item[Do you have any form of employment? Give brief details]
\answ{No}

% question 11
\item[Lectures/seminars/conferences attended since last report] \

\answ{Courses taken: Domain theory, Categories, Proofs and programs. Conferences: I helped organizing CSL 2005,
In August 2005 I attended the \emph{Marktoberdorf Summer School}. In July 2005 I attended \emph{Program transformation and Analysis} (PAT) in Copenhagen.
In February 2006 I visited the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge. I have presented a project during the Computer Laboratories open days.
}

% question 12
\item[How has your work gone in the past six months?] \

\answ{
I studied a restriction of lambda-calculus called ``safe
lambda-calculus'' as described in \cite{safety-mirlong2004}. My goal
will be to determine some nice properties on safe lambda terms (for
instance whether a safe lambda term is size-change terminating, see
\cite{jones01,blum-mscthesis}).
}

\answ{
I worked on a project with Matthew Hagues and Luke Ong
about LTL model checking. We develop an algorithm based on techniques described in
\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/McMillan03, ckos2005, hammer:truly}. We implemented it in OCaml and C.
The property and the Kripke structure of the model are defined in a NuSMV file.
...
}

% question 13
\item[Research plan for the next term and vacation] \

I plan to extend the result I obtained for game semantics of simply typed term to Idealized Algol programs and investigate
the implication it has an algorithmic game semantics.

I also want to investigate some application of game semantics to program analysis and transformation.
