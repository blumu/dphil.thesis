
Checklist when collecting the bound copies  
=============================================
=============================================

(The page numbers refer to thesis-Bodleian.pdf.)

Be careful when you manipulate the book, please manipulate it slowly when you turn the pages
and touch only the *edge* of the pages when you turn them.

Also take your time to check everything on the spot before you leave the shop.
Don't rush.

If you see anything wrong tell them and be firm: refuse any technical explanation for something that
is obviously wrong. It should look perfect (for that price...)!


If you see a problem (even minor) with a copy do *not* take it. 
Leave it to them and tell them I will call them.


==== Overall

Check overall aspect, it should look *professional*. In particular

- printing quality: no ink stain, clear contrast for fonts (no shadow arround letters)
- no folds on pages
- binding: should be at least as good as a book you would buy from a shop.
- check the spine of the binding: the spelling of my name and the year should be 2008.
- the pages will be trimed on the right edge: check that this is done cleanly, straight, and that no page is longer than the others.
- for the single-side version: check that everything appears on the right side only.
- for the double-sided versions: odd number pages are on the right and even page on the left


==== Content

Check that nothing is missing. In particular check that it contains the followings:

- front page (should be on the right) with the *University Crest* properly rendered.
- abstract
- table of contents
- list of tables, figures
- chapters from 1 to 7
- bibliography
- index of notations
- index



==== Figures and diagrams

Check the following pages (the best would be to take your laptop with you to compare wiht the PDF.):


front page: check the university crest.

p87 and p90 check that the table frame as well as the rounded frames inside are correctly printed

p102 check that the curved arrows are properly rendered in Table 4.2.
p103 check that the curved arrows are properly rendered.
p104 check the dotted lines in the diagrams
p105 check dotted lines and curved arrows

p118 check rendering of trees and arrows in diagrams

p127 check rendering of diagrams

p129 check this important diagram

p136 check diagram

p148 check diagram
p153 check diagram
p155 check diagrams in Table 4.3
p157 check arrows in Table 4.4


p173 check that colours in the diagram are properly rendered in black and white

p192 check bottom diagram

p197 check diagram + rendering of colour in B&B (must be readable)
