\section{Getting to Oxford}

\textbf{Arriving by Air}.  There is a very convenient bus service from
\textbf{London Heathrow} to Oxford, \textbfit{the airline}, that runs
every 20 minutes. A return fare is \pounds 18. The journey takes 70 -
90 minutes. The bus may be boarded from Bay 14, Central Bus Station if
you arrive at Terminals 1, 2 and 3; or at Bay 15 if you arrive at
Terminal 4. For further information on the service (timetables, etc.)
see the Oxford Bus Company website
\url{http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/}. Tickets may be bought on the bus.
If you arrive at \textbf{London Gatwick}, you can board \emph{the
airline} from Gatwick North Terminal Bay 4. The service runs every
hour. A return fare is \pounds 24. The journey takes roughly 120
minutes.

The \emph{airline} bus will terminate at the Gloucester Green Bus
Station in Oxford city centre; you will be able to catch a taxi there.
If you are staying at Merton College, you may wish to get off at the
Queen's Lane (which is off High Street) stop -- Merton College is
roughly 200 metres away.

\medskip

If you arrive at the \textbf{London City Airport}, take the Airport
Shuttlebus to Liverpool Street Underground Station, and then take the
Underground train to Paddington Station. You will be able to catch a
train to Oxford from the Paddington Rail Station. The train journey
will take approximately an hour.

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{Arriving by Train}. If travelling by train, you will arrive
at the Oxford Rail Station.  Merton Colleges and most hotels are a
long walk from the Station, and you will probably want to proceed by
taxi. Taxis arrive continuously, and you shouldn't have to wait long.

\section{The Conference Location: Denys Wilkinson Building}

The Conference will be held in the \textbf{Dennis Sciama Lecture
Theatre}, \textbf{Denys Wilkinson Building}, which is part of the
Department of Physics (number 38 on the map below).  Access to the
Building is from the Banbury Road end of Keble Road, via the concrete
stairs (just next to a bicycle shed).

\noindent \textbf{Tea and coffee breaks} will be at the 5th floor
foyer area, Denys Wilkinson Building.

\medskip

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{sciencearea}
\end{center}


\subsubsection*{Please Note:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbfit{Do wear your badges at all times}. We have been told
that from Monday 22 August noon onwards, no participant will be
allowed into the Denys Wilkinson Building without their participant
badge. 

\item \textbfit{No eating or drinking is permitted in the Dennis Sciama Lecture
Theatre.}

\item \textbfit{We need to vacate the Lecture Theatre by 6pm on
  Monday, Wednesday and Thursday} - please cooperate.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{From Merton College to the Denys Wilkinson Building}
\textbf{Merton College} and the \textbf{Denys Wilkinson Building} are
marked out in the following map. There is a straightforward route from
the College to the DW Building (indicated in green): Magpie Lane
(which is off the cobblestoned Merton Street), Catte Street, Parks
Road, and then Keble Road. The journey takes about 15 minute on foot.

\medskip

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{approach}
\end{center}

\section{Information for Speakers}
The Dennis Sciama Lecture Theatre has a \textbf{blackboard}, an
\textbf{overhead slide projector} and a \textbf{data projector}.  If
you use computer-generated slides, you should liaise with the
audio-visual technician during the coffee/tea breaks or early in the
day (08:45-09:00) to load up your presentations well before your talk.

Speakers are requested to \textbf{end their talk 5 mins before} the
alloted time, so as to leave some time for questions.

\section{Reception and Registration}
The first pre-conference event is a \textbf{guided tour of Merton
College}, 17:00-17:45 Sunday 21 August. The assembly point is just
outside the Porter's Lodge.

There will be a drinks reception 18:00-20:00 Sunday 21 August, in the
\textbf{Savile Room, Merton College} at (the cobblestoned) Merton
Street; some finger food will also be served. You will be able to
register for the conference during the reception. 

For those who miss the reception, there will be another opportunity to
register at 08:30 Monday 22 August, just before the start of the
conference at the \textbf{Registration Desk (Tel: +44 1865 273434)},
which is in the foyer of the Dennis Sciama Lecture Theatre.


\section{Email and Internet Access}
The \textbf{Internet Room} is directly opposite the Dennis
Sciama Lecture Theatre, in the Denys Wilkinson Building.  A number of
workstations, preset to webdemo mode, are provided for participants to
check their email (by \textsc{ssh}) and access the Internet.

\noindent\textbf{Wireless network}.  There is a wireless network
covering the Dennis Sciama Lecture Theatre, the Internet Room, and the
General Common Room in the Dennis Wilkinson Building.  If you have
given us the MAC address of your laptop, you should be able to gain
access by setting the following parameters:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Service Set Identifier (SSID)} & \texttt{Physics\_M}\\
\textbf{WEP 128-bit encryption key} & \texttt{f672c67945b4478ff9145571df}
\end{tabular}

\noindent When in the Denys Wilkinson Building, some laptops may pick
up the SSID automatically. Unfortunately Merton College is unable to
provide any IT facilities for conference residents.

\section{Merton College}

Merton College was founded in 1264. It is one of three ancient Oxford
colleges founded in the thirteenth century. The College buildings, set
in extensive gardens and grounds, are of exceptional historical and
aesthetic interest. The Library is probably the oldest surviving
working library in the United Kingdom, and the Hall, Chapel, Lodge and
Mob Quadrangle also date from the College's early years.

The College's founder was Walter de Merton, Lord Chancellor of England
and Bishop of Rochester. Walter's conception of a self-governing
community of scholars, with its own statutes and endowment, residing
in buildings laid out in staircases and quadrangles, created a model
and precedent for Oxford and Cambridge colleges founded in the
succeeding centuries.

Merton College is one of many colleges that, together with
departments, faculties, laboratories, libraries and other academic
institutions, comprise the University of Oxford.  The relationship
between the Oxford colleges and the University has evolved throughout
the centuries. The colleges are self-governing institutions that
provide academic, domestic and social facilities to their student
members. Teaching provision for most undergraduate degree courses at
Oxford is concentrated in the colleges, but examinations are
administered by the University, which has sole power to confer
degrees.

Merton College is administered by a Governing Body consisting of the
Warden and Fellows. The Warden is the Head of College. The Fellowship
includes teaching Fellows, or Tutors, who are responsible for tuition
and pastoral care of undergraduates. Most Tutors also have University
duties. Other Fellows include Professorial Fellows (who also hold
University posts), Research Fellows and College Officers, such as the
Senior Tutor, Librarian, Chaplain and Bursar.

\subsection*{Merton College Accommodations}

\noindent\textbf{Arrival}. If you have reserved Merton College
accommodation, please call at the Porter's Lodge directly on
arrival. The Porter will explain how to get to your room, and give you
your room key, and a late gate key, which can be used to enter and
leave the College when the Lodge gate is closed between 22:30 and
07:00. Please retain your keys for the duration of your stay with
us. \textbf{Breakfast} will be served at 07:45 in the Hall.

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{Departure}. You are requested to vacate your room by
10:00 on the last day of the conference. Please remember to return
your keys to the College Lodge.

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{Contact Information}. If you need information about
the College facilities, please contact the Conference Manager, Mrs Kim
Cameron (tel.~(2)76363) during office hours 09:30 - 17:30 Monday to
Friday, or the duty porter (tel.~(2)76310) at any time. Please note the
Porter should not be contacted between 23:00 and 07:00 except in
emergency.

\medskip

\noindent\textbf{Guided Tour of the College}. There will be a guided tour of
the College, including a visit to the Old Library (the oldest library
in Britain in continuous use), at the following times:

\begin{tabular}{l}
17:00-17:45 Sunday 21 August\\ 18:30-19:15 Wednesday 24 August
\end{tabular}

\noindent Please assemble just outside the Porter's Lodge. Each tour
will be limited to a maximum of 20 people, on a first come first serve
basis. 

\medskip
 
For further information, see the \emph{Information for
Delegates}. There is a map of the College in the \emph{Guide to Merton
College}.

\section{Excursion to Bletchley Park}

On Tuesday 23rd August we have arranged a trip to \textbf{Bletchley
Park}. During World War II the German armed forces top secret codes
were broken at Bletchley Park, providing the allies with vital
information towards their war effort.  Situated 50 miles North-West of
London, the site played host to a diverse group of code breakers,
including Alan Turing and Dilly Knox. Among the ciphers that were
broken were Enigma and Lorenz. For further details, see
\url{http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/}.  

We will travel to Bletchley Park by coach. \textbfit{The coaches will
leave from the junction of Keble Road and Parks Road at 13:15, Tuesday
23 August}. We will leave Bletchley Park at 17:30 and expect to arrive
back at Oxford around 18:15, traffic permitting.

\section{Banquet}
For those who missed the Sunday tour, there will be another
\textbf{guided tour of Merton College}, 18:30-19:15 Wednesday 24
August, just before the banquet. Please assemble just outside the
Porter's Lodge. 

The conference banquet will be held in the Hall of the College.

\textit{What's On} section of \url{http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/}.


\begin{description}

\item[Odeon Cinemas] Mainstream cinema.  Split between George Street
(map reference D5) and Magdalen Street (map reference D4).

\verb+http://www.odeon.co.uk/+ (go to ``Times and Booking (text
version)'' if Flash doesn't work.)

\item[Phoenix Picturehouse] Map reference B1.  More arthouse, but not
completely obscure.

\verb+http://www.picturehouses.co.uk/site/cinemas/Oxford/local.htm+

\item[Ultimate Picture Palace] Map reference J7.  No frills cinema
showing films from all over the world. Also fairly cheap.

\verb+http://www.ultimatepicturepalace.co.uk/+

\item[New Theatre] Map reference D5.  Lots of shows and musicals.

\verb+http://www.thisistheatre.com/regional/oxfordtheatre.html+


\item[Oxford Playhouse] Map reference D4.  As the name suggests, the

\section{Emergency and Other Information}

Prefix for Oxford phone numbers: + 44 1865. 

\noindent For more information about Oxford, visit the dailyinfo
website: \url{http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/}.

\subsubsection*{Emergency Services}

The number for emergency services in the UK (Fire, Police, Ambulance)
is 999 or 112. The international standard emergency telephone number
for GSM mobile phone networks is 112.

\subsubsection*{Getting to London Heathrow or Gatwick}

You can catch the bus service, \textbfit{the airline}, from the
Gloucester Green Bus Station in the City Centre, or from a bus stop
along High Street (right next to Queen's Lane). 

\subsubsection*{Taxis}

\begin{description}
\item[Hackney Cabs] You can pick one up at a taxi rank at St.Giles, Gloucester Green
(tel: 770077), or the railway station. You can also hail Hackney
cabs in the street.


Fares: A minimum of \pounds 1.50, then about 90p per mile
    (Sample Fares:
    the city centre to any of the Park and Rides is about 3 miles and costs about \pounds 4,
      Heathrow - \pounds 55,
      Gatwick - \pounds 90,
      Central London - \pounds 75)


Hackney Cabs are licensed and limited in numbers by the city
council. However they are also reputed to have a generally better
local knowledge than drivers of hire cars.  They are made specifically
for their job and provide easier access for those with mobility
difficulties.


\item[Hire Cars] Hire cars (or minicabs) are not licensed individually
(rather on a per company basis) and are normally not specialised
vehicles.

They are not allowed to pick up passengers who hail them on the
street. You need to phone their HQ and they will send a vehicle for
you. They are often cheaper than a Hackney Cab.

Fares vary.

Contact: ABC Taxis: 770077 or 775577. RadioTaxis: 242424 or 249743.
001 Taxis: 240000. Royal Cars: 777333

\item[CCB Airport Cars] Tel: 876699. Run to and from Heathrow,
Gatwick, Luton and Birmingham.

\noindent Computer Science Logic (CSL) is the annual conference of the European
Association for Computer Science Logic (EACSL). The conference series
started as a programme of International Workshops on Computer Science
Logic, and then in its sixth meeting became the Annual Conference of
the EACSL. This conference is the 19th meeting and 14th EACSL
conference; it is organized by the Computing Laboratory at the
University of Oxford.
