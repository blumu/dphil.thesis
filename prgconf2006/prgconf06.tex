\section{Game semantics}

My work is concerned with the study of the ``Safe
$\lambda$-calculus''. This calculus is a strict restriction of the
$\lambda$-calculus where terms are required to satisfy a property
called \emph{Safety}. Originally, safety has been defined in
\cite{KNU02} as a syntactic restriction for higher-order recursion
schemes. In their paper they proved that the MSO theory of the term
tree generated by a safe recursion scheme of level $n$ is decidable
(it has been shown more recently in \cite{OngLics2006} that the
safety assumption is in fact not necessary).

I am interested in the transposition of the safety property from
grammars to lambda terms. A definition of the safe
$\lambda$-calculus was first given in a technical report
\citep{safety-mirlong2004}. One interesting property is that
performing substitution on safe terms does not require a renaming of
the variable.

I propose have investigated different possible definitions of a safe
lambda calculus and have proposed a more general notion of safety
that does not assume homogeneity of types while still preserving the
``no variable renaming'' property.

%I also tried to relate the safety restriction and the
%\emph{size-change termination} property defined in
%\cite{jones01,jones04}. Jones conjectured that any simply-typed term
%is size-change terminating, however Damien Sereni disproved this
%conjecture by exhibiting a class of counter-examples
%(\cite{serenistypesct05}). It turns out that the simply-typed terms
%of this class are all safe (but not necessary of homogeneous type)
%and not size-change terminating. This suggests that there is no real
%interesting relation between safety and size-change termination.


Recently, inspired by my reading on game semantics
\citep{abramsky:game-semantics-tutorial} and by the techniques
developed by Luke Ong in \citep{OngLics2006}, I have proved a result
on the game semantics of safe terms: the pointers in the game
semantics of safe simply-typed terms can be recovered uniquely from
the sequence of moves. This result is similar to the standard result
in game semantics which says that pointers of strategies can be
recovered uniquely for arena of order 2 at most. A consequence of
this result is that the game semantics of Finatary $IA_2$ terms can
be described by (extended) regular expressions
\cite{ghicamccusker00}.
