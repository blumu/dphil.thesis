\section{Safe PCF}

We define the computation tree of a term to be the least upper bound of the computation trees of its approximants. A term containing a Y combinator may have an infinite computation tree. This is an undesired feature since we would like to derive a DPDA with finite states from the computation tree where each state corresponds to a node of the computation tree.

We therefore need to use an alternative definition of computation tree for Safe PCF terms.  We introduce a new type of abstraction node, written $\lambda_{rec}(f) x_1 \ldots x_n$ for some variable names $f, x_1, \ldots x_n$.

The 


The disadvantage of this defintion is that we have to redefine the function $\varphi$ that maps nodes to moves. We also need to define a new traversal rules to hanlde the new type of node.
