\section{Well-bracketing and incremental-justification}

We consider an arena $A$ and make the following two assumptions on it:
\begin{itemize}
\item (A1) For $A \neq \bot$ (the arena with a single initial question), each question move in the arena enables at least one answer move.
\item (A2) Answer moves do not enable any other move.
\end{itemize}

We define the \defname{order} of a move $m$, written $\ord{m}$, as
the length of the path from $m$ to its furthest leaf in the arena minus 1
({\it i.e.} the height of the subarena rooted at $m$ minus 2.).
Because of assumptions (A1) and (A2),  
for any move $m$ of $A \neq \bot$, $m$ is question move if and only if $\ord{m} \geq 0$, and $m$ is an answer move if and only if $\ord{m} = -1$.





We call \defname{pending question} of a sequence of moves $s \in L_A$ the last unanswered question in $s$. 

\begin{definition}\rm
A strategy $\sigma$ is said to be \defname{P-well-bracketed} if for any play $s \, a \in \sigma$ where $a$ is a  P-answer, $a$ points to the pending question in $s$. 
\end{definition}



P-well-bracketing can be restated differently as the following proposition shows:
\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:char_wellbrack}
\rm We make assumption (A1) and (A2).
Let $\sigma$ be a strategy on an arena $A\neq \bot$.
The following statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $\sigma$ is P-well-bracketed,
\item[(ii)] for $s \, a \in \sigma$ with $a$ a P-answer, $a$ points to the pending question in $\pview{s}$,
\item[(iii)] for $s \, a \in \sigma$ with $a$ a P-answer, $a$ points to the last O-question in $\pview{s}$.
\item[(iv)] for $s \, a \in \sigma$ with $a$ a P-answer, $a$ points to the last O-move in $\pview{s}$ with order $>\ord{a}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
$(i)\iff(ii)$: \cite[Lemma 2.1]{McC96b} states that if P is to move then the pending question in $s$ is the same as that of $\pview{s}$.

$(ii)\iff(iii)$: Assumption (A2) implies that the pending question in $\pview{s}$ is also the last O-question occurring in $\pview{s}$.

$(iii)\iff(iv)$: Because of assumption (A1) and (A2),
for any move $m$, we have $m$ is a question move 
if and only if $\ord{m} \geq 0$ if and only if $\ord{m} > \ord{a} = -1$.
\end{proof}




\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:justfied_by_unanswered}
Under assumption (A2), if $s$ be a justified sequence of moves satisfying alternation and visibility then any O-move (resp. P-move) in $s$ points to an \emph{unanswered} P question (resp. O-question).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that an O-move $c$ points to a P-move $d$ that has already been answered by the O-move $a$. The sequence $s$ as the following form:
$$ s= \ldots \Pstr{(d){d}  \ldots  (a-d,20){a}  \ldots  (c-d,20){c}}$$

By O-visibility, $d$ must belong to $\oview{s_{<c}}$. But since $a$ is an answer, by assumption (A2), it cannot justify any P-move, therefore 
$\oview{s_{<q}}$ must contain an OP-arc ``hoping'' over $a$. We name the nodes of this arc $d^1$ and $c^1$:
$$ s = \ldots \Pstr{(d){d}  \ldots  (d1){d^1} \ldots (a-d,20){a} \ldots
 (c1-d1,20){c^1} \ldots (c-d,25){c}}$$


By P-visibility, $d^1$ must belong to $\pview{s_{<c^1}}$.
Consequently, $a$ does not belong to $\pview{s_{<c^1}}$ (otherwise the PO-arc 
$\Pstr[0.5cm]{(d){d} \quad (a-d,45){a}}$ would cause the P-view to jump over $d^1$).
Therefore there must be a PO-arc $\Pstr[0.5cm]{(d2){d^2} \quad (c2-d2,45){c^2}}$ in
$\pview{s_{<c^1}}$ hoping over $a$:
$$ s = \ldots \Pstr[0.7cm]{(d){d}  \ldots  
(d1){d^1} \ldots (d2){c^2} \ldots
(a-d,20){a} \ldots
 (c2-d2,20){d^2} \ldots (c1-d1,20){c^1} \ldots (c-d,25){c}}$$

This process can be repeated infinitely often by using alternatively O-visibility and P-visibility. This gives a contradiction since the sequence of moves $s_{<c}$ has finite length.
Hence $d$ cannot point to a question that has already been answered. Since, by assumption (A2), a question is enabled by another question, $d$ is necessarily justified by an unanswered question.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:oq_in_pview_unanswered}
Under assumption (A2), if $s$ is a P-well-bracketed justified sequence of moves of odd length satisfying alternation and visibility then  all O-questions occurring in $\pview{s}$ are unanswered in $s$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We proof the first part by induction on $s$.
The base case ($s = q$ with $q$ initial O-move) is trivial.

Suppose $\Pstr[0.4cm]{ s = s' \cdot (n)n \cdot u \cdot (m-n,45){m} }$.
Let $r$ be an O-question in $\pview{s} = \pview{s'} \cdot n \cdot m$.
If $r$ is the last move $m$ then it is necessarily unanswered.
If $r \in \pview{s'}$ then by the induction hypothesis, $r$ is unanswered in $s'$.
Suppose that $r$ is answered in $s$. This implies that some answer move $a$ in $u$ points to $r$:
$$\pstr[0.5cm][5pt]{ s = \underbrace{\cdots\ \lnk(r){r}^O \cdots }_{s'} \ 
\lnk(n){n}^P \ 
\underbrace{\cdots\ \lnk(a-r,35){a}^P \cdots }_{u}
\  \lnk(m-n,30){m}^O } \ .$$
Since $m$ points to $n$, by lemma \ref{lem:justfied_by_unanswered}, $n$ is still unanswered at $s_{\leq a}$. Therefore the pending question at $s_{\leq a}$ 
cannot be $r$. But $a$ is justified by $r$, therefore the well-bracketing condition is violated. Hence $r$ is unanswered in $s$.
\end{proof}





\begin{definition}\rm
  A strategy $\sigma$ is said to be \defname{P-incrementally
    justified} if for any play $s \, q \in \sigma$ where $q$ is a
  P-question, $q$ points to the last unanswered O-question in $\pview{s}$ with
  order strictly greater than $\ord{q}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:char_pincr}
\rm We make assumption (A1) and (A2).
Let $\sigma$ be a \emph{P-well-bracketed} strategy on an arena $A\neq \bot$.
The following statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $\sigma$ is P-incrementally-justified,
\item[(ii)] for $s \, q \in \sigma$ with $q$ a P-question, $q$ points to the last O-question in $\pview{s}$ with order $>\ord{q}$,
\item[(iii)] for $s \, q \in \sigma$ with $q$ a P-question, $q$ points to the last O-move in $\pview{s}$ with order $>\ord{q}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
$(i)\iff(ii)$: By lemma \ref{lem:oq_in_pview_unanswered}, O-question occurring in $\pview{s}$ are all unanswered.

$(ii)\iff(iii)$: Because of (A1) and (A2), $\ord{q} \geq 0$ thus an O-move with order $>\ord{q}$ is necessarily an O-question.
\end{proof}

Putting proposition \ref{prop:char_pincr} and
\ref{prop:char_wellbrack} together we obtain:
\begin{proposition}
Under assumption (A1) and (A2).
A strategy $\sigma$ on $A\neq \bot$
is \emph{P-well-bracketed} and 
 \emph{P-incrementally-justified} if and only if
for $s \, m \in \sigma$, $m$ points to the last O-move in $\pview{s}$ with order $>\ord{m}$.
\end{proposition}

\section{Compositionality}


Let $X$ and $Y$ be two arenas.
For any move $m$ of the arena $X$ we write $m^{X\rightarrow Y}$ to denote the same move seen as move of the component $X$ of the arena $X\rightarrow Y$.
Similarly we use the notation $m^{Y\rightarrow X}$.
We write $\ordx{X}{m}$ to denote $\ord{m}$, the order of the move $m$ in the arena $X$, $\ordx{X\rightarrow Y}{m}$ to denote the order of $m^{X\rightarrow Y}$ (in the arena $X\rightarrow Y$) and $\ordx{Y\rightarrow X}{m}$ to denote the order of $m^{Y\rightarrow X}$.

\begin{lemma}
%Let $A \stackrel{\sigma}{\rightarrow} B$ and $B \stackrel{\mu}{\rightarrow} C$ be two strategies for some games $A$, $B$ and $C$. 
Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be three arenas. We have:
$$\begin{array}{lll}
\forall m \in A: 
	&  \ord{m}_{A\rightarrow B} = \ord{m}_{A\rightarrow C}\\
\forall m \in B: 
	& \ord{m}_{A\rightarrow B} \geq \ord{m}_{B\rightarrow C} \ , & \mbox{for $m$ initial,}\\
	& \ord{m}_{A\rightarrow B} = \ord{m}_{B\rightarrow C}\ , & \mbox{for $m$ non initial,} \\
\forall m \in C: 
	& \ord{m}_{A\rightarrow C} \geq \ord{m}_{B\rightarrow C} \iff 
\ord{A} \geq \ord{B}\ & \mbox{for $m$ initial,}\\
	& \ord{m}_{A\rightarrow C} = \ord{m}_{B\rightarrow C} 	& \mbox{for $m$ non initial.} 
\end{array}
$$
\end{lemma}





\section{Homogeneity constraint}

Type homogeneity is not preserved after composition. Indeed the types  $o \longrightarrow (o \rightarrow o)$ and $(o \rightarrow o) \longrightarrow \left((o \rightarrow o) \rightarrow o \right)$ are homogeneous
but $o \longrightarrow \left((o \rightarrow o) \rightarrow o\right)$ is not.



\section{unfinished section}

We can show the following property by an easy induction :
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:interaction_projection}
 Let $u$ be an interaction sequence in $Int(A,B,C)$ then
$$\pview{u} \upharpoonright A,C = \pview{u \upharpoonright A,C} \ .$$
\end{lemma}

The P-view of an interaction sequence $u \in Int(A,B,C)$ is defined as:
\begin{align*}
\pview{u\cdot \extomove{n}} &= \extomove{n} &
\mbox{ if \extomove{$m$} is an \extomove{external O-move} initial in C,}\\
\pview{\Pstr{u\cdot (m)m\cdot v \cdot (n-m,45){\extomove{n}} }} &= \extomove{n} &\mbox{ if \extomove{$m$} is an \extomove{external O-move} non initial in C,}\\
\pview{u \cdot \extpmove{m}} &= \pview{u}\cdot \extpmove{m} & \mbox{ if \extpmove{$m$} is a \extpmove{generalized P-move}.}\\
\end{align*}
