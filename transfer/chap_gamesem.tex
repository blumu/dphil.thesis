\section{Semantics of programming languages}

Before the introduction of game semantics in the 1990s, there were
principally two kinds of models for programming languages:
operational semantics and denotational semantics. Operational
semantics defines a program using rewriting rules. whereas
denotational semantics defines a program using mathematical
function.

In the 1990s, a new kind of semantics called game semantics has been
introduced for modeling programming languages. In game semantics,
the meaning of a program is given by a strategy in a two-player
game. The two players are the opponent, representing the
environment, and the Proponent, representing the program itself.


\subsection{Model for PCF}

The problem of the Full Abstraction for PCF goes back to the 1970s.

Scott gave a model for PCF based on domain theory (\cite{scott93}).

The Scott domain based model of PCF is not fully abstract, i.e.
there exist two PCF terms which are observationally equivalent but
their domain denotation is different. This is a consequence from the
fact that the parallel-or operator defined by the following truth
table is not definable as a PCF term:

\begin{tabular}{l|lll}
p-or  & $\bot$ & tt & ff \\
$\bot$ & $\bot$ & tt & $\bot$\\
tt & tt & tt & tt\\
ff & $\bot$ & tt & ff\\
\end{tabular}

The undefinability of this term can be exploited to prove that the
model is not fully abstract. It is possible to create two terms that
behave the same except when the parameter is a term computing p-or.
Since p-or is not definable in PCF, these two terms will in fact be
equivalent.

It is possible to patch PCF by adding the operator $p-or$, the
resulting language ``PCF+p-or'' is fully-abstracted by Scott domain
theoretic model. However the language we are now dealing with is
strictly more powerful than PCF, it has some parallel execution
power that PCF has not.

Also, we may want to get rid of the undefinable elements (like p-or)
by strengthening the conditions on the function used in the model (a
condition strong than strictness and continuity) but unfortunately
this approach did not succeed.

Hence the problem remains: is there any fully abstract model for
PCF?

Solutions to the full abstraction problem for PCF have eventually
been discovered in the 1990s by three different independent research
groups: Ambramsky, Jagadeesan and Malacaria \cite{abramsky94full},
Hyland and Ong \cite{hylandong_pcf} and Nickau. There are all based
on game semantics.

\section{PCF}
\subsection{The syntax of the language}
PCF is a simply-type $\lambda$-calculus with the following
additions: integer constants  (of ground type), first-order
arithmetic operators, if-then-else branching, and the recursion
combinator $Y_A : (A\rightarrow A)\rightarrow A$ for any type $A$.

The types of PCF are given by the following grammar:
$$ T ::= \texttt{exp}\ |\ T \rightarrow T$$

The following grammar gives the structure of terms:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 M ::= x\ |\ \lambda x :A . M \ |\ M M \ |\ \\
\ |\ n \ |\ \texttt{succ} M \ |\  \texttt{pred} M \\
\ |\ \texttt{cond} M M M \ |\ Y_A M
\end{eqnarray*}

where $x$ ranges over a set of countably many variables and $n$
ranges over the set of natural numbers.

Terms are generated according to the formation rules given in table
\ref{tab:pcf_formrules} where the judgement is of the form $ \Gamma  \vdash M : A$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
$$ (var) \rule{}{x_1:A_1, x_2:A_2, \ldots x_n : A_n  \vdash x_i : A_i}\ i \in 1..n$$
$$ (app) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : A\rightarrow B \qquad \Gamma \vdash N:A}{\Gamma \vdash M\ N : B}
\qquad (abs) \rule{\Gamma, x:A \vdash M : B}{\Gamma \vdash \lambda x :A . M : A\rightarrow B}$$

$$ (const) \rule{}{\Gamma \vdash n :\texttt{exp}}
\qquad (succ) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M:\texttt{exp} }{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{succ}\ M:\texttt{exp}}
\qquad (pred) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M:\texttt{exp} }{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{pred}\ M:\texttt{exp}}$$

$$
(cond) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : exp \qquad \Gamma \vdash N_1 : exp \qquad \Gamma \vdash N_2 : exp }{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{cond}\ M\ N_1\ N_2}
\qquad  (rec) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : A\rightarrow A }{ \Gamma \vdash Y_A M : A}$$

\caption{Formation rules for PCF terms}
\label{tab:pcf_formrules}
\end{table}

\subsection{Operational semantics}

We give the big-step operational semantics of PCF. The notation $M \eval V$ means
that the closed term $M$ evaluates to the canonical form $V$. The canonical forms are given by the following
grammar:
$$V ::= n\ |\ \lambda x. M$$
In other word, a canonical form is either a number or a function.

The operational semantics is given for closed terms therefore the context $\Gamma$ is not present in
the evaluation rules.

The full operational semantics is given in table \ref{tab:bigstep_pcf}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
$$\rule{}{V \eval V} \quad \mbox{ provided that $V$ is in canonical form.} $$

$$ \rule{M \eval \lambda x. M' \quad M'\subst{x}{N}}{M N \eval V}$$

$$\rule{M \eval n}{\texttt{succ}\ M \eval n+1}
\qquad \rule{M \eval n+1}{\texttt{pred}\ M \eval n}
\qquad \rule{M \eval 0}{\texttt{pred}\ M \eval 0}$$

$$\rule{M \eval 0 \quad N_1 \eval V}{\texttt{cond}\ M N_1 N_2  \eval V}
\qquad
 \rule{M \eval n+1 \quad N_2 \eval V}{\texttt{cond}\ M N_1 N_2  \eval V}$$

$$\rule{M (\mathrm{Y} M) \eval V }{\texttt{Y} M \eval V}$$

\section{Idealized Algol (IA)}
\label{sec:ia}

\subsection{The syntax of IA}
IA is an extension of PCF introduced by J.C. Reynold in
\cite{Reynolds81}. It adds imperative features such as local variables and sequential composition.

The description of the language that we give here follows the one of \cite{abramsky:game-semantics}.

On top of \texttt{exp}, PCF has the following two new types:
 \texttt{com} for commands and \texttt{var} for variables.

There is a constant \texttt{skip} of type \texttt{com} which corresponds to the command that do
nothing. Commands can be composed using the sequential composition operator \texttt{seq}.
Local variable are declared using the \texttt{new} operator, variable content is written
using \texttt{assign} and retrieved using \texttt{deref}.

The new formations rules are given in table \ref{tab:ia_formrules}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
$$ \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : \texttt{com} \quad \Gamma \vdash N :A}
    {\Gamma \vdash \texttt{seq}_A \ M\ N\ : A} \quad A \in \{ \texttt{com}, \texttt{exp}\}$$

$$ \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : \texttt{var} \quad \Gamma \vdash N : \texttt{exp}}
    {\Gamma \vdash \texttt{assign}\ M\ N\ : \texttt{com}}
\qquad
 \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : \texttt{var}}
    {\Gamma \vdash \texttt{deref}\ M\ : \texttt{exp}}$$

$$ \rule{\Gamma, x : \texttt{var} \vdash M : A}
    {\Gamma \vdash \texttt{new } x \texttt{ in } M} \quad A \in \{ \texttt{com}, \texttt{exp}\}$$

$$ \rule{\Gamma \vdash M_1 : \texttt{exp} \rightarrow \texttt{com} \quad \Gamma \vdash M_2 : \texttt{exp}}
    {\Gamma \vdash \texttt{mkvar } M_1\ M_2\ : \texttt{var}}$$

\caption{Formation rules for IA terms}
\label{tab:ia_formrules}
\end{table}

If $\vdash M : A$ (i.e. $M$ can be formed with an empty context), we say that $M$ is a close term.

\subsection{Operational semantics}

In IA the semantics is given in a slightly different form from PCF.
In PCF, the evaluation rules were given for closed terms only. Suppose that we
proceed the same way for IA and consider the evaluation rule for the $\texttt{new}$ construct:
the conclusion is $\texttt{new } x:=0 \texttt{ in } M$ and the premise
is an evaluation for a certain term constructed from $M$, more precisely the term $M$
where \emph{some} occurrences of $x$ are replaced by the value $0$.
Because of the presence of the \texttt{assign} operator, we cannot simply replace all
the occurrences of $x$ in $M$ (the required substitution is  more complicated
than the substitution used for beta-reduction).


Therefore, instead of giving the semantics for closed term we consider terms
whose free variables are all of type \texttt{var}. These free variables are ``closed'' by mean of
stores. A store is a function mapping free variables of type \texttt{var} to natural numbers.
Suppose $\Gamma$ is a context containing only variable of type \texttt{var}, then we say that
$\Gamma$ is a \texttt{var}-context. A store whose domain $\Gamma$ is called a $\Gamma$-store.

The notation $s\ |\ x \mapsto n$ refers to the store that maps $x$ to $n$
and otherwise maps variables according to the store $s$.


The canonical forms for IA are given by the grammar:
$$ V ::= n\ |\ \lambda x. M\ |\ x\ |\  \texttt{mkvar} M N$$

where $n \in \nat$ and $x:var$.


A program is now defined by a term together with a $\Gamma$-store such that $\Gamma \vdash M : A$.
The evaluation semantics is expressed by the judgment form
$$s,M \eval s', V$$
where $s$ and $s'$ are $\Gamma$-stores,
$\Gamma \vdash M : A$ and $\Gamma \vdash V : A$ where $V$ is in canonical form.

The operational semantics for IA is given by the rule of PCF (table \ref{tab:bigstep_pcf})
together with the rules of table \ref{tab:bigstep_ia} where the following abbreviation is used:
$$ \rule{M_1 \eval V_1 \quad M_2 \eval V_2}{M \eval V} \qquad \mbox{for} \qquad
  \rule{s,M_1 \eval s',V_1 \quad s', M_2 \eval s'',V_2 }{s,M \eval s'',V}
$$


\begin{table}[htbp]
$$\mbox{\textbf{Sequencing }}
    \rule{M \eval \skip \quad N \eval V}{\texttt{seq } M\ N \eval V}
$$

$$\mbox{\textbf{Variables }}
    \rule{s,N \eval s',n \quad s',M \eval s'',x}{s, \assign\ M\ N \eval (s''\ |\ x \mapsto n),\skip}
\qquad
    \rule{s,M \eval s',x }{s, \deref\ M \eval s',s'(x)}$$

$$\mbox{\texttt{\textbf{mkvar}}}
    \rule{N \eval n \quad M \eval \texttt{mkvar } M_1\ M_2 \quad M_1\ n \eval \skip}
    {\assign\ M\ N \eval \skip}
\qquad
    \rule{N \eval \texttt{mkvar } M_1\ M_2 \quad M_2\ \eval n}
    {\deref\ M \eval n}
$$

$$\mbox{\textbf{Block}}
    \rule{(s\ |\ x \mapsto 0),M \eval (s'\ |\ x \mapsto n),V }
    {s, \texttt{new } x \texttt{ in } M \eval s',V}
$$

\subsection{Game semantics}

As we have seen in section \ref{subsec:catgames}, games and strategies
form a cartesian closed category, therefore games can model the simply-typed $\lambda$-calculus. Let us first
explain how this is achieved before extending the model to PCF and IA.

\subsubsection{Simply typed $\lambda$-calculus}

In the category $\mathcal{C}$, the objects are the arenas and the morphisms are the strategies.
Moreover $\mathcal{C}$ is a cartesian closed category.

Given a simple type $A$, we will model it as an arena $\sem{A}$.
A context $\Gamma = x_1 :A_1, \ldots x_n:A_n$ will be mapped to the arena
$\sem{\Gamma} = \sem{A_1} \times \ldots \times \sem{A_n}$ and a term $\Gamma \vdash M : A$
will be modeled by a strategy on the arena $\sem{\Gamma} \rightarrow \sem{A}$.
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is cartesian closed, there is is a terminal object $\textbf{1}$ (the empty arena) that
modeling the empty context ($\sem{\Gamma} = \textbf{1}$).


The base type \texttt{exp} is interpreted by the following flat arena of natural numbers noted $\nat$:
\begin{center}
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    {\TR[name=R]{q}}
    { \TR{1} \TR{2} \TR{\ldots}
    }
\end{center}
In this arena, there is only one question: the initial O-question, P can then answer it by playing a natural number $i \in \nat$.
There are only two kinds strategy on this arena:
\begin{itemize}
\item the empty strategy where P never answer the initial question. This corresponds to a non terminating computation;
\item the strategies where P answers by playing a number $n$. This models the constants of the language.
\end{itemize}

Given the interpretation of base types, we define the interpretation of $A\rightarrow B$ by induction:
$$\sem{A \rightarrow B} = \sem{A} \Rightarrow \sem{B}$$

where the operator $\Rightarrow$ denotes the arena construction $!A \multimap B$ which exist because $\mathcal{C}$ is cartesian closed.

Graphically if we represent the arena $A$ and $B$ by two triangles, the arena for $A \rightarrow B$ would be represented by:
\begin{center}
\psset{xunit=.5pt,yunit=.5pt,runit=.5pt}
\begin{pspicture}(150,80)
\rput[tr](150,80){ \pnode(27,40){a} \pstribox{A} }
\rput[bl](0,0){ \pnode(27,40){b} \pstribox{B} }
\ncline{->}{a}{b}
\end{pspicture}
\end{center}


Variables are interpreted by projection:
$$\sem{\Gamma : A_1, \ldots, x_n:A_n} = \pi_i : \sem{A_i} \times \ldots \times \sem{A_i} \times \ldots \sem{A_n} \rightarrow \sem{A_i}$$

The abstraction $\Gamma \vdash \lambda x :A.M : A \rightarrow B$ is modeled by a strategy on the arena
$\sem{\Gamma} \rightarrow (\sem{A}\Rightarrow\sem{B})$. This strategy is obtain by using the currying operator of the
cartesian closed category:
$$\sem{\Gamma \vdash \lambda x :A.M : A \rightarrow B} = \Lambda( \sem{\Gamma, x :A \vdash M : B})$$

The application $\Gamma \vdash M N$ is modeled using the evaluation map $ev_{A,B} : (A\Rightarrow B)\times A \rightarrow B$:

$$\sem{\Gamma \vdash M N} = \langle \sem{\Gamma \vdash M, \Gamma \vdash N} \rangle; ev_{A,B}$$


\subsubsection{PCF}

We now show how to model the PCF constructs in the game semantics setting.
In the following, the sub-arena of a game are tagged in order to distinguish identical arenas that are present in different components of the game.
Moves are also tagged in the exponent in order to identify the sub-arena in which moves are played. We will omit the pointers in the play
when they are not essential for the understanding of the model (moreover we will see later on that under certain assumptions
up to order 2, pointers can be recovered uniquely).

The successor arithmetic operator is modeled by the following strategy on the arena $\nat^1 \Rightarrow \nat^0$:
$$\sem{\texttt{succ}} = \{q^0 \cdot q^1 \cdot n^1 \cdot (n+1)^0\ |\ n \in \nat \}$$

The predecessor arithmetic operator is denoted by the strategy
$$\sem{\texttt{pred}} = \{q^0 \cdot q^1 \cdot n^1 \cdot (n-1)^0\ |\ n >0 \} \union \{ q^0 \cdot q^1 \cdot 0^1 \cdot 0^0 \} $$

Then given a term $\Gamma \vdash \texttt{succ} M : \texttt{exp}$ we define:
$$\sem{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{succ } M : \texttt{exp}} = \sem{\Gamma \vdash M} ; \sem{\texttt{succ}} $$
$$\sem{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{pred } M : \texttt{exp}} = \sem{\Gamma \vdash M} ; \sem{\texttt{pred}} $$


The conditional operator is denoted by the following strategy on the arena $\nat^3 \times \nat^2 \times \nat ^1 \Rightarrow \nat^0$:
$$\sem{\texttt{cond}} =
    \{ q^0 \cdot q^3 \cdot 0 \cdot q^2 \cdot n^2 \cdot n^0 \ | \ n \in \nat \}
    \union
    \{ q^0 \cdot q^3 \cdot m \cdot q^2 \cdot n^2 \cdot n^0 \ | \ m >0, n \in \nat \}
    $$


Given a term $\Gamma \vdash \texttt{cond} M\ N_1\ N_2$ we define:
$$\sem{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{cond} M\ N_1\ N_2} =
\langle \sem{\Gamma \vdash M}, \sem{\Gamma \vdash N_1}, \sem{\Gamma \vdash N_2} \rangle ; \sem{\texttt{cond}}$$


The interpreation of the \texttt{Y} combinator is a bit more complicated.

Consider the term $\Gamma \vdash M : A \rightarrow A$, its semantics $f$ is a strategy on $\sem{\Gamma} \times \sem{A} \rightarrow \sem{A}$.
We define the chain $g_n$ of strategies on the arena $\sem{\Gamma} \rightarrow \sem{A}$ as follow:
\begin{eqnarray*}
g_0 &=& \perp \\
g_{n+1} &=&  F(g_n) = \langle id_{\sem{\Gamma}}, g_n\rangle ; f
\end{eqnarray*}

where $\perp$ denotes the empty strategy $\{ \epsilon \}$.

It is easy to see that indeed the $g_n$ forms a chain.
We define $\sem{\texttt{Y } M}$ to be the least upper bound of the chain $g_n$
(i.e. the  least fixed point of $F$). Its existence is guaranteed by the fact that
the category of games is cpo-enriched.

\subsubsection{IA}

It is easy to check that all the strategies given until now are well-bracketed and innocent.
From now on, we will only require well-bracketing and we will introduce strategies that are
not innocent. This is a necessity if we want to give a model of memory cells that correspond
to variables. The intuition behind this fact is that a cell needs to remember what was the last value written in it
in order to be able to return it when it is read, and this can only be done by looking at the whole history of moves,
not only those present in the P-view.





\subsection{Full-abstraction}
In this section we recall the standard full abstraction result proved in  \cite{abramsky94full}
and \cite{hylandong_pcf}.

A context noted $C[-]$ is a term containing a hole denoted by $-$. If $C[-]$ is a context then $C[A]$ denotes the term obtained
after replacing the hole by the term $A$.

\begin{dfn}[Observational preorder]
Let $\vdash M : A$ and $\vdash N : A$ be two closed terms. We define the relation $\sqsubseteq$ as follow:


$M \sqsubseteq N$ if and only if for all context $C[-]$ such that $C[M]$ and $C[M]$ are well-formed terms if
$C[M] \eval$ then $C[N] \eval$.
\end{dfn}


\begin{lem}[Soundness for PCF terms] Let $M$ be a PCF term.
If $M \eval V$ then $\sem{M} = \sem{V}$.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}[Soundness for IA terms] Let $\Gamma \vdash M : A$ be an IA term and a $\Gamma$ store $s$.
If $s,M \eval s',V$ then the plays of $\sem{s,M} : I \multimap A \otimes !\Gamma$ which begin
with a move of $A$ are identical to those of $\sem{s',V}$.
\end{lem}


\begin{lem}[Computational adequacy for PCF terms]
All PCF terms are computable. (i.e. $\sem{M} \neq \perp$ implies $M \eval$)
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}[Computational adequacy for IA terms]
All IA terms are computable. (i.e. $\sem{M} \neq \perp$ implies $M \eval$)
\end{lem}


The following result follows from soundness and computational adequacy of the model.
\begin{prop}[Inequational soundness]
\label{prop:ineqsoundness}
Let $M$ and $N$ be two closed terms then
$$\sem{M} \subseteq \sem{N} \implies  M \sqsubseteq N $$
\end{prop}

\begin{prop}[Definability]
\label{prop:definability}
Let $\sigma$ be a compact well-bracketed on a game $A$ denoting a IA type. Then there is
an IA-term $M$ such that $\sem{M} = \sigma$.
\end{prop}

The final standard result of game semantics can then be proved using proposition \ref{prop:ineqsoundness} and \ref{prop:definability}:
\begin{thm}[Full abstraction]
Let $M$ and $N$ be two closed IA-terms.
$$\sem{M} \precsim_b \sem{N} \ \iff \ M \sqsubseteq N$$
\end{thm}

where $\precsim_b$ denotes the intrinsic preorder of the category $\mathcal{C}_b$.


\subsection{Second order}

\begin{lem}[Pointers are superfluous up to order 2]
Let $A$ be the arena corresponding to a PCF type of order at most 2.

Let $s$ be a justified sequence of moves in the arena $A$ satisfying
 alternation, visibility and well-bracketing then
the pointers of the sequence $s$ can be reconstructed uniquely.
\end{lem}



\begin{proof}
The only base type here is \typexp. It is interpreted by the
following flat game of natural numbers $\natbf$:
\begin{center}
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    {\TR[name=R]{q}}
    { \TR{1} \TR{2} \TR{\ldots}
    }
\end{center}

Let $T$ be a PCF type of order at most 2. $T = T_1 \rightarrow T_2
\rightarrow \ldots T_n \rightarrow \typexp$. Let $I_k = \{ 1.. n\ |\
\order{T_i} = k \}$ for $k = 0..1$.

The arenas $T_i$ for $i \in I_0$ and $T_j$ for $j \in I_1$ are given
below:
\begin{center}
\
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    {\TR{$q_i$}}
    { \TR{$1_i$} \TR{$2_i$} \TR{\ldots} }
\hspace{2cm}
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    { \TR{$q'_j$} }
    {
      \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
        { \TR{$q_j$} }
        { \TR{$1_j$} \TR{$2_j$} \TR{\ldots} }
      \TR{$1'_j$} \TR{$2'_j$} \TR{\ldots}
    }
\end{center}

The entire arena $A$ is
\begin{center}
\
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    { \TR{$q$} }
    {
\SubTree{$T_1$} \SubTree[linestyle=dashed]{$T_i$} \SubTree{$T_n$}
    \TR{1} \TR{2} \TR{\ldots} }
\end{center}

where each triangle represents one of the two possible sub arena.
