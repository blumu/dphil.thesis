\section{Semantics of programming languages}

Before the introduction of game semantics in the 1990s, there were
principally two kinds of models for programming languages:
operational semantics and denotational semantics. Operational
semantics defines a program using rewriting rules. whereas
denotational semantics defines a program using mathematical
function.

In the 1990s, a new kind of semantics called game semantics has been
introduced for modeling programming languages. In game semantics,
the meaning of a program is given by a strategy in a two-player
game. The two players are the opponent, representing the
environment, and the Proponent, representing the program itself.


\subsection{Model for PCF}

The problem of the Full Abstraction for PCF goes back to the 1970s.

Scott gave a model for PCF based on domain theory (\cite{scott93}).

The Scott domain based model of PCF is not fully abstract, i.e.
there exist two PCF terms which are observationally equivalent but
their domain denotation is different. This is a consequence from the
fact that the parallel-or operator defined by the following truth
table is not definable as a PCF term:

\begin{tabular}{l|lll}
p-or  & $\bot$ & tt & ff \\
$\bot$ & $\bot$ & tt & $\bot$\\
tt & tt & tt & tt\\
ff & $\bot$ & tt & ff\\
\end{tabular}

The undefinability of this term can be exploited to prove that the
model is not fully abstract. It is possible to create two terms that
behave the same except when the parameter is a term computing p-or.
Since p-or is not definable in PCF, these two terms will in fact be
equivalent.

It is possible to patch PCF by adding the operator $p-or$, the
resulting language ``PCF+p-or'' is fully-abstracted by Scott domain
theoretic model. However the language we are now dealing with is
strictly more powerful than PCF, it has some parallel execution
power that PCF has not.

Also, we may want to get rid of the undefinable elements (like p-or)
by strengthening the conditions on the function used in the model (a
condition strong than strictness and continuity) but unfortunately
this approach did not succeed.

Hence the problem remains: is there any fully abstract model for
PCF?

Solutions to the full abstraction problem for PCF have eventually
been discovered in the 1990s by three different independent research
groups: Ambramsky, Jagadeesan and Malacaria \cite{abramsky94full},
Hyland and Ong \cite{hylandong_pcf} and Nickau. There are all based
on game semantics.


\section{Game semantics of PCF}
\subsection{The language PCF}
PCF is a simply-type $\lambda$-calculus with the following
additions: integer constants  (of ground type), first-order
arithmetic operators, if-then-else branching, and the recursion
combinator $Y_A : (A\rightarrow A)\rightarrow A$ for any type $A$.

The types of PCF are given by the following grammar:
$$ T ::= \texttt{exp}\ |\ T \rightarrow T$$

The following grammar gives the structure of terms:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 M ::= x\ |\ \lambda x :A . M \ |\ M M \ |\ \\
\ |\ n \ |\ \texttt{succ} M \ |\  \texttt{pred} M \\
\ |\ \texttt{cond} M M M \ |\ Y_A M
\end{eqnarray*}

where $x$ ranges over a set of countably many variables and $n$
ranges over the set of natural numbers.

Terms are generated according to the formation rules given in table
\ref{tab:pcf_formrules} where the judgement is of the form $ \Gamma  \vdash M : A$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
$$ (var) \rule{}{x_1:A_1, x_2:A_2, \ldots x_n : A_n  \vdash x_i : A_i}\ i \in 1..n$$
$$ (app) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : A\rightarrow B \qquad \Gamma \vdash N:A}{\Gamma \vdash M\ N : B}
\qquad (abs) \rule{\Gamma, x:A \vdash M : B}{\Gamma \vdash \lambda x :A . M : A\rightarrow B}$$

$$ (const) \rule{}{\Gamma \vdash n :\texttt{exp}}
\qquad (succ) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M:\texttt{exp} }{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{succ}\ M:\texttt{exp}}
\qquad (pred) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M:\texttt{exp} }{\Gamma \vdash \texttt{pred}\ M:\texttt{exp}}$$

$$
(cond) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : exp \qquad N_1 : exp \qquad N_2 : exp }{\texttt{cond}\ M\ N_1\ N_2}
\qquad  (rec) \rule{\Gamma \vdash M : A\rightarrow A }{ \Gamma \vdash Y_A M : A}$$

\section{Game semantics of IA}
\subsection{The language IA}
IA is an extension of PCF introduced by J.C. Reynold in
\cite{Reynolds81}.

\subsection{Remark}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Well-bracketing condition is a condition on P-answers only, it does
not constraint O-answers (see \cite{abramsky:game-semantics}).

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Second order}

\begin{lem}[Pointers are superfluous up to order 2]
Let $A$ be the arena corresponding to a PCF type of order at most 2.

Let $s$ be a justified sequence of moves in the arena $A$ satisfying
 alternation, visibility and well-bracketing then
the pointers of the sequence $s$ can be reconstructed uniquely.
\end{lem}



\begin{proof}
The only base type here is \typexp. The interpretation of it is the
flat game of natural numbers $\natbf$. The arena is:
\begin{center}
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    {\TR[name=R]{q}}
    { \TR{1} \TR{2} \TR{\ldots}
    }
\end{center}

Let $T$ be a PCF type of order at most 2. $T = T_1 \rightarrow T_2
\rightarrow \ldots T_n \rightarrow \typexp$. Let $I_k = \{ 1.. n\ |\
\order{T_i} = k \}$ for $k = 0..1$.

The arenas $T_i$ for $i \in I_0$ and $T_j$ for $j \in I_1$ are given
below:
\begin{center}
\
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    {\TR{$q_i$}}
    { \TR{$1_i$} \TR{$2_i$} \TR{\ldots} }
\hspace{2cm}
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    { \TR{$q'_j$} }
    {
      \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
        { \TR{$q_j$} }
        { \TR{$1_j$} \TR{$2_j$} \TR{\ldots} }
      \TR{$1'_j$} \TR{$2'_j$} \TR{\ldots}
    }
\end{center}

The entire arena $A$ is
\newcommand{\SubTree}[2][]{\Tr[ref=t]{\pstribox[#1]{#2}}}
\begin{center}
\
  \pstree[levelsep=6ex]
    { \TR{$q$} }
    {
\SubTree{$T_1$} \SubTree[linestyle=dashed]{$T_i$} \SubTree{$T_n$}
    \TR{1} \TR{2} \TR{\ldots} }
\end{center}

where each triangle represents one of the two possible sub arena.
