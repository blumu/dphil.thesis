
In \cite{KNU02}, Knapik et al. studied the infinite hierarchy of
trees recognized by a higher-order pushdown automaton. They
introduce a restriction on higher-order grammars called
\emph{safety} and they show that trees recognized by pushdown
automata of level $n$ coincides with trees generated by
safe-higher-order grammars of level $n$. This characterization
permits them to show that the monadic second-order theory of an
infinite tree recognized by a higher-order pushdown automaton of any
level is decidable.

Safety has also appeared in a different form in \cite{Dam82} under
the name \emph{restriction of derived types}. The forthcoming thesis
of Jolie de Miranda \citep{demirandathesis} contains a comparison of
safety and the restriction of derived types.

More recently, Ong proved in \cite{OngLics2006} that the safety
assumption of \cite{KNU02} is in fact not necessary. More precisely,
the paper shows that MSO theory of trees generated by order-$n$
recursion schemes is $n$-EXPTIME complete.

For this particular problem, \emph{safety} happens to be an
artificial restriction. However when the \emph{safety} condition is
transposed to the simply-type $\lambda$-calculus, it gives some
interesting properties. In particular, alpha-conversion of terms
becomes unnecessary when performing substitution on safe terms. We
therefore think that \emph{safety} is a property that is worth
studying.

This chapter starts with a presentation of the original version of
the Safe $\lambda$-calculus where types are required to satisfy a
condition called homogeneity. We then give a more general definition
that does not require type homogeneity.

The third section is concerned about the study of game semantics of
simply-typed terms. We present the notion of computation tree and
traversal of a computation tree following the ideas of
\cite{OngLics2006}. We then establish a correspondence between game
semantics and traversals of the computation tree.

In the following section we use the correspondence theorem to
establish a characterization of game semantics of safe terms. We
will prove that safe terms in $\beta$-normal form are exactly the
simply-typed terms that are denoted by what we call \emph{regular
strategies}. A nice property of regular strategies is that pointers
can be recovered uniquely from the sequences of moves.

Finally, we give some hints for a possible extension of the result
to Safe Idealized Algol, a fragment of Idealized Algol where the
application rule and abstraction rule are constrained as in the safe
$\lambda$-calculus.
