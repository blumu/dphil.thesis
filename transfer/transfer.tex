\chapter{Summary}

\section{Research activities}

\subsection{Courses attended}

I have attended the following courses: \emph{Automata Logic and
Games} in Hilary term 2005, \emph{Domain theory} in Michaelmas term
2005 and \emph{Categories Proofs and Programs} in Hilary term 2006.

\subsection{Teaching}

I have been demonstrating \emph{Network and Operating Systems} in
Hilary term 2005 and I have been tutoring and marking two classes
for \emph{Introduction to Specification} in Michaelmas 2005.

\subsection{Meetings and conferences}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bonn spring school on GAMES;

\item  In March 2005, I attended BCTCS (British Colloquium in
Theoretical Computer Science) in Nottingham  where I gave a talk
about my MSc dissertation ``Termination analysis of a subset of
CoreML'';

\item PAT (Program transformation and analysis) 2005 Copenhagen;
\item Marktoberdorf Summer School;
\item CSL (Computer Science Logic) 2005;
\item Visit to the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge in February
2006.
\end{itemize}


\section{Research proposal}

\part{Background}
\chapter{Program verification}
LTL model checking. LWAA. Project with Matthew and Luke.

\chapter{Program transformation and analysis}


\chapter{Game semantics}

History-free strategies: moves determined by the last move of the
Opponent.

History-sensitive strategy: moves determined by the entire history
of plays.

Innocent strategies: moves determined on the basis of the view of
the history of the play at the point being played.


\subsection{notes} For IA$_2$, complete plays are representable by
regular languages, hence program approximation and equivalence is
decidable.

\subsection{Application to program analysis}
abstraction refinement, data-abstraction refinement, modular
abstraction, inter-procedural data flow analysis, predicate
abstraction.
